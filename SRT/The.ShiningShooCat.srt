1
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,928
Hi. I've got an appointment
with Mr. Ullman.

2
00:03:15,178 --> 00:03:17,014
My name is Jack Torrance.

3
00:03:17,265 --> 00:03:19,809
His office is the first door
on the left.

4
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:21,185
Thank you.

5
00:03:38,581 --> 00:03:39,373
Mr. Ullman?

6
00:03:39,665 --> 00:03:40,876
I'm Jack Torrance.

7
00:03:41,126 --> 00:03:43,086
Come on in, Jack.

8
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,674
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

9
00:03:46,924 --> 00:03:48,469
This is my secretary, Susie.

10
00:03:48,844 --> 00:03:51,346
- Susie, how do you do?
- Any trouble finding us?

11
00:03:51,597 --> 00:03:54,349
No problem at all.
I made the trip in 31/2 hours.

12
00:03:54,558 --> 00:03:56,519
That's very good time.

13
00:03:56,895 --> 00:03:58,438
Sit down a minute, Jack.

14
00:03:58,688 --> 00:04:00,440
Just make yourself at home.

15
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:01,858
Like some coffee?

16
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,612
If you're having some,
I wouldn't mind. Thanks.

17
00:04:04,863 --> 00:04:05,739
- Susie.
- Sure.

18
00:04:06,031 --> 00:04:07,698
And ask Bill Watson to join us.

19
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,450
Yes, I will.

20
00:04:20,254 --> 00:04:21,422
Mom?

21
00:04:22,215 --> 00:04:23,424
Yeah?

22
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,429
Do you really want to go and live
in that hotel for the winter?

23
00:04:28,097 --> 00:04:29,390
Sure I do.

24
00:04:29,641 --> 00:04:31,559
It'll be lots of fun.

25
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:35,564
Yeah. I guess so.

26
00:04:35,773 --> 00:04:39,944
Anyway, there's hardly anybody
to play with around here.

27
00:04:40,736 --> 00:04:44,282
I know. It always takes
a little time to make new friends.

28
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,121
Yeah, I guess so.

29
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:49,872
What about Tony?

30
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,417
He's looking forward
to the hotel, I bet.

31
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:55,462
No, I ain't, Mrs. Torrance.

32
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:58,174
Now, come on, Tony.
Don't be silly.

33
00:04:58,675 --> 00:05:00,593
I don't want to go there.

34
00:05:01,136 --> 00:05:03,138
How come you don't want to go?

35
00:05:03,388 --> 00:05:05,136
I just don't.

36
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:07,936
Let's just wait and see.

37
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:10,905
We're all going to have
a real good time.

38
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,749
Bill, I'd like you
to meet Jack Torrance.

39
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,383
How do you do, Bill?

40
00:05:16,585 --> 00:05:18,553
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you.

41
00:05:18,754 --> 00:05:20,688
Grab a chair, Bill. Join in.

42
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:25,020
Jack is going to take care of
the Overlook for us this winter.

43
00:05:25,261 --> 00:05:28,230
I'd like you to take him around
soon as we're through.

44
00:05:28,432 --> 00:05:29,365
Fine.

45
00:05:30,002 --> 00:05:31,902
Jack is a schoolteacher.

46
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,138
Formerly a schoolteacher.

47
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:36,034
What line of work are you in now?

48
00:05:36,241 --> 00:05:37,834
I'm a writer.

49
00:05:38,077 --> 00:05:41,706
Teaching's been more or less
a way of making ends meet.

50
00:05:41,914 --> 00:05:43,882
This ought to be
quite a change for you.

51
00:05:44,818 --> 00:05:46,615
I'm looking for a change.

52
00:05:46,821 --> 00:05:50,416
Our people in Denver recommended
Jack very highly, and for once...

53
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,217
...I agree with them.

54
00:05:52,862 --> 00:05:54,659
Let's see, where were we?

55
00:05:54,864 --> 00:05:57,457
I was about to explain...

56
00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:01,864
...that our season here runs from
May 15th to October 30th.

57
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:05,529
Then we close down completely
until the following May.

58
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:08,540
Do you mind if I ask
why you do that?

59
00:06:08,746 --> 00:06:12,204
It seems to me that the skiing
up here would be fantastic.

60
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:15,011
It would be. The problem is
the enormous cost...

61
00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:17,780
...it would be to keep
the road to Sidewinder open.

62
00:06:18,424 --> 00:06:20,153
It's a 25-mile stretch of road.

63
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:22,725
It gets 20 feet of snow
during the winter.

64
00:06:22,928 --> 00:06:26,160
There's just no way to make it
economically feasible...

65
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:28,300
...to keep it clear.

66
00:06:28,502 --> 00:06:30,868
When the place was built in 1907...

67
00:06:31,072 --> 00:06:33,633
...there was very little interest
in winter sports.

68
00:06:33,842 --> 00:06:38,711
This site was chosen for its
seclusion and scenic beauty.

69
00:06:38,947 --> 00:06:41,473
It's certainly got
plenty of that.

70
00:06:41,684 --> 00:06:42,878
That's right.

71
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:45,912
Did they give you
any idea in Denver...

72
00:06:46,162 --> 00:06:47,789
...about what the job entails?

73
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,126
Only in a very general way.

74
00:06:52,337 --> 00:06:55,007
The winters can be
fantastically cruel.

75
00:06:55,257 --> 00:06:58,594
The basic idea is to cope
with the very costly damage...

76
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:00,804
...and depreciation
which can occur.

77
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:03,475
This consists mainly
of running the boiler...

78
00:07:03,725 --> 00:07:07,646
...heating different parts of the
hotel on a daily rotating basis...

79
00:07:07,896 --> 00:07:10,525
...repairing damage as it occurs...

80
00:07:10,818 --> 00:07:13,612
...and doing repairs so the
elements can't get a foothold.

81
00:07:14,696 --> 00:07:16,949
That sounds fine to me.

82
00:07:17,324 --> 00:07:20,245
Physically, it's not
a very demanding job.

83
00:07:20,453 --> 00:07:23,581
The only thing that can get a bit
trying here during the winter...

84
00:07:23,873 --> 00:07:26,460
...is a tremendous sense
of isolation.

85
00:07:27,628 --> 00:07:32,216
That just happens to be
exactly what I'm looking for.

86
00:07:32,592 --> 00:07:35,721
I'm outlining a new
writing project.

87
00:07:36,097 --> 00:07:39,392
Five months of peace
is just what I want.

88
00:07:40,184 --> 00:07:41,937
That's very good, Jack.

89
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:45,356
Because, for some people...

90
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,316
...solitude...

91
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,110
...and isolation...

92
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:52,240
...can, of itself, become a problem.

93
00:07:53,074 --> 00:07:54,742
Not for me.

94
00:07:55,243 --> 00:07:58,414
How about your wife and son?
Do you think they'll take to it?

95
00:08:00,249 --> 00:08:01,333
They'll love it.

96
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:02,835
Great.

97
00:08:05,755 --> 00:08:08,925
Before I turn you over to Bill...

98
00:08:09,217 --> 00:08:12,596
...there's one other thing I think
we should talk about.

99
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,308
Not to sound melodramatic...

100
00:08:14,558 --> 00:08:17,060
...but it's been known to
give a few people...

101
00:08:17,269 --> 00:08:19,479
...second thoughts about the job.

102
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:21,816
I'm intrigued.

103
00:08:22,025 --> 00:08:24,360
I don't suppose they
said anything in Denver...

104
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:28,532
...about the tragedy we had up here
during the winter of 1970.

105
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:31,118
I don't believe they did.

106
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:35,415
My predecessor in this job...

107
00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:39,420
...hired a man named Charles Grady
as the winter caretaker.

108
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:43,090
He came up with his wife and
2 little girls of about 8 and 10.

109
00:08:43,341 --> 00:08:46,345
He had a good employment record,
good references.

110
00:08:46,595 --> 00:08:48,805
And from what I've been told,
he seemed...

111
00:08:49,056 --> 00:08:51,683
...like a completely
normal individual.

112
00:08:51,977 --> 00:08:54,271
But at some point
during the winter...

113
00:08:54,522 --> 00:08:58,150
...he must have suffered some kind
of a complete mental breakdown.

114
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,695
He ran amuck...

115
00:09:04,115 --> 00:09:06,284
...and killed his family
with an ax.

116
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:12,208
Stacked them neatly in a room
in the west wing, and then...

117
00:09:13,043 --> 00:09:16,714
...he put both barrels
of his shotgun in his mouth.

118
00:09:18,007 --> 00:09:19,759
The police thought...

119
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:24,014
...that it was what the old-timers
used to call cabin fever.

120
00:09:24,265 --> 00:09:27,268
A kind of claustrophobic reaction
which can occur...

121
00:09:27,518 --> 00:09:31,648
...when people are shut in together
over long periods of time.

122
00:09:36,736 --> 00:09:38,071
That is...

123
00:09:38,321 --> 00:09:39,824
...quite a story.

124
00:09:41,158 --> 00:09:42,618
Yeah, it is.

125
00:09:43,703 --> 00:09:47,082
It's still hard for me to believe
it actually happened here.

126
00:09:47,374 --> 00:09:49,042
But it did.

127
00:09:50,836 --> 00:09:54,841
I think you can appreciate
why I wanted to tell you about it.

128
00:09:55,426 --> 00:09:57,887
I certainly can.

129
00:09:58,387 --> 00:10:00,973
I also understand
why your people in Denver...

130
00:10:01,223 --> 00:10:03,435
...left it for you to tell me.

131
00:10:04,644 --> 00:10:07,314
Obviously, some people
can be put off...

132
00:10:07,564 --> 00:10:11,611
...from staying in a place where
something like that happened.

133
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:16,699
You can rest assured that's not
going to happen with me.

134
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,580
And as far as my wife
is concerned...

135
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:24,667
...I'm sure she'll be absolutely
fascinated when I tell her.

136
00:10:24,918 --> 00:10:27,671
She's a confirmed ghost story...

137
00:10:27,963 --> 00:10:30,299
...and horror film addict.

138
00:10:36,181 --> 00:10:39,893
Tony, do you think
Dad'll get the job?

139
00:10:41,312 --> 00:10:43,523
He already did.

140
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,652
He's going to phone Wendy up
in a few minutes to tell her.

141
00:11:02,378 --> 00:11:05,048
- Hi, babe.
- Hi, hon. How's it going?

142
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:08,802
Great. I'm at the hotel and
I still have a lot to do.

143
00:11:09,094 --> 00:11:12,139
I don't think I can get home
before 9 or 10.

144
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,849
Sounds like you got the job.

145
00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:16,770
Right. It's a beautiful place.

146
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,106
You and Danny are going to love it.

147
00:11:20,608 --> 00:11:23,527
Tony, why don't you want to go
to the hotel?

148
00:11:23,777 --> 00:11:25,487
I don't know.

149
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:30,118
You do too know.
Now come on, tell me.

150
00:11:30,702 --> 00:11:32,787
I don't want to.

151
00:11:33,496 --> 00:11:34,747
Please.

152
00:11:35,917 --> 00:11:37,085
No.

153
00:11:37,377 --> 00:11:39,504
Now, Tony, tell me.

154
00:12:09,066 --> 00:12:11,796
Now, hold your eyes still
so I can see.

155
00:12:16,275 --> 00:12:18,505
That's good. Now the other one.

156
00:12:19,912 --> 00:12:21,379
Good boy.

157
00:12:28,722 --> 00:12:30,088
Now, Danny...

158
00:12:30,558 --> 00:12:32,583
...when you were brushing
your teeth...

159
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:35,786
...do you remember if you
smelled anything funny...

160
00:12:35,998 --> 00:12:40,766
...or saw any bright, flashing
lights or anything at all strange?

161
00:12:43,607 --> 00:12:44,767
No.

162
00:12:45,843 --> 00:12:48,334
Do you remember when you were
brushing your teeth?

163
00:12:48,913 --> 00:12:50,210
Yes.

164
00:12:51,349 --> 00:12:54,979
What's the next thing you remember
after you were brushing your teeth?

165
00:12:59,192 --> 00:13:01,821
My mom was saying, "Wake up.
Wake up, Danny, wake up."

166
00:13:06,033 --> 00:13:08,263
Can you remember
what you were doing...

167
00:13:08,469 --> 00:13:11,405
...just before you started
brushing your teeth?

168
00:13:13,908 --> 00:13:15,671
Talking to Tony.

169
00:13:16,343 --> 00:13:18,710
Is Tony one of your animals?

170
00:13:19,582 --> 00:13:22,517
No. He's a little boy
that lives in my mouth.

171
00:13:22,818 --> 00:13:25,219
Tony's his imaginary friend.

172
00:13:28,158 --> 00:13:31,559
If you were to open your mouth now,
could I see Tony?

173
00:13:34,232 --> 00:13:35,460
Why not?

174
00:13:36,734 --> 00:13:38,565
Because he hides.

175
00:13:39,305 --> 00:13:40,967
Where does he go?

176
00:13:42,075 --> 00:13:43,872
To my stomach.

177
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:48,814
Does Tony ever tell you
to do things?

178
00:13:52,887 --> 00:13:55,549
I don't want to talk
about Tony anymore.

179
00:13:58,194 --> 00:13:59,627
That's fine.

180
00:14:00,396 --> 00:14:02,193
All right, Danny.

181
00:14:02,999 --> 00:14:05,798
I'm going to ask you
to do me a favor...

182
00:14:06,003 --> 00:14:09,370
...and stay quietly in bed
for the rest of the day. Okay?

183
00:14:09,573 --> 00:14:10,699
Do I have to?

184
00:14:10,908 --> 00:14:13,173
Yes. I'd like you to.

185
00:14:13,378 --> 00:14:16,142
We're going in the other room
for a few minutes and talk.

186
00:14:16,348 --> 00:14:18,475
I'll come back and check on you.

187
00:14:26,995 --> 00:14:29,395
- Shall we go into the living room?
- Yes.

188
00:14:33,101 --> 00:14:34,967
- Please.
- Thank you.

189
00:14:38,842 --> 00:14:43,212
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think
you have anything to worry about.

190
00:14:43,414 --> 00:14:47,441
I'm quite sure there's nothing
physically wrong with Danny.

191
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,318
He seems absolutely fine now.

192
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:56,516
But you should've seen him.

193
00:14:57,195 --> 00:14:58,220
I know.

194
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:00,126
Kids can scare you to death.

195
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:03,200
But believe me, these episodes
are not at all uncommon.

196
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,964
And they look much worse
than they are.

197
00:15:06,507 --> 00:15:09,169
But what was the matter with him?

198
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:13,472
Most of the time, these episodes
with kids are never explained.

199
00:15:13,682 --> 00:15:18,551
They're brought on by emotional
factors and rarely occur again.

200
00:15:19,354 --> 00:15:22,324
They're more akin
to autohypnosis...

201
00:15:22,526 --> 00:15:25,495
...a kind of self-induced trance.

202
00:15:25,696 --> 00:15:27,687
If it reoccurs, which I doubt...

203
00:15:28,565 --> 00:15:31,660
...we can always think about
having some tests done.

204
00:15:34,272 --> 00:15:36,536
I'm sure you're right.

205
00:15:38,177 --> 00:15:40,873
Have you been in Boulder long?

206
00:15:41,681 --> 00:15:42,978
Only about three months.

207
00:15:43,183 --> 00:15:46,551
We're from Vermont. My husband
was teaching school there.

208
00:15:48,556 --> 00:15:52,356
Did the appearance
of Danny's imaginary friend...

209
00:15:52,794 --> 00:15:53,624
Tony.

210
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:57,788
Did Tony's first appearance happen
to coincide with your arrival here?

211
00:16:00,904 --> 00:16:02,235
Let's see...

212
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,500
I guess Danny started
talking to Tony...

213
00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:08,406
...about the time we put him
in nursery school.

214
00:16:08,813 --> 00:16:11,111
Did he adjust well to school?

215
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:15,252
He didn't like it too much
at first.

216
00:16:15,453 --> 00:16:18,753
Then he had an injury, so we kept
him out for a while and...

217
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:24,062
I guess that's about when I first
noticed he was talking to Tony.

218
00:16:25,066 --> 00:16:27,466
What sort of injury did he have?

219
00:16:28,136 --> 00:16:30,297
He dislocated his shoulder.

220
00:16:30,772 --> 00:16:33,037
How did he manage to do that?

221
00:16:36,478 --> 00:16:39,539
It was just one of
those things, you know.

222
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,740
Purely an accident.

223
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,518
My husband had been drinking...

224
00:16:45,723 --> 00:16:49,057
...and he came home
about three hours late.

225
00:16:49,361 --> 00:16:53,922
So he wasn't exactly
in the greatest mood that night.

226
00:16:54,665 --> 00:16:59,433
And Danny had scattered some of his
school papers all over the room...

227
00:16:59,638 --> 00:17:03,939
...and my husband grabbed his arm
to pull him away from them.

228
00:17:04,144 --> 00:17:07,204
It's just the sort of thing you do
100 times with a child...

229
00:17:07,414 --> 00:17:09,439
...you know, in a park
or in the street.

230
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:13,180
But on this particular occasion...

231
00:17:13,388 --> 00:17:16,016
...my husband just used
too much strength...

232
00:17:16,224 --> 00:17:18,819
...and he injured Danny's arm.

233
00:17:21,864 --> 00:17:26,393
Anyway, something good did come out
of it all because he said...

234
00:17:26,637 --> 00:17:29,197
..."Wendy, I'm never going to
touch another drop.

235
00:17:29,407 --> 00:17:31,341
And if I do, you can leave me."

236
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:32,873
And he didn't.

237
00:17:33,077 --> 00:17:37,572
He hasn't had any
alcohol in 5 months.

238
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:08,798
We must really be high up.
The air feels so different.

239
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,639
Dad?

240
00:18:18,475 --> 00:18:20,185
I'm hungry.

241
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,733
You should've eaten your breakfast.

242
00:18:25,568 --> 00:18:28,446
We'll get you something
as soon as we get to the hotel.

243
00:18:28,697 --> 00:18:30,324
Okay, Mom.

244
00:18:31,783 --> 00:18:35,912
Wasn't it around here that
the Donner party got snowbound?

245
00:18:37,624 --> 00:18:41,168
I think that was farther west,
in the Sierras.

246
00:18:42,586 --> 00:18:45,048
What was the Donner party?

247
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:51,221
They were a party of settlers
in covered wagon times.

248
00:18:51,472 --> 00:18:54,684
They got snowbound one winter
in the mountains.

249
00:18:54,893 --> 00:18:59,147
They had to resort to cannibalism
in order to stay alive.

250
00:19:00,232 --> 00:19:03,152
You mean they ate each other up?

251
00:19:03,361 --> 00:19:06,447
They had to, in order to survive.

252
00:19:06,698 --> 00:19:07,909
Jack.

253
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,202
Don't worry, Mom.

254
00:19:09,452 --> 00:19:13,665
I know all about cannibalism.
I saw it on TV.

255
00:19:13,915 --> 00:19:16,585
See, it's okay.

256
00:19:16,794 --> 00:19:19,213
He saw it on the television.

257
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,751
- What time does the plane leave?
- 8:30.

258
00:19:52,002 --> 00:19:54,714
That gives us plenty of time
to go over everything.

259
00:19:54,964 --> 00:19:56,882
- Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
- Bye.

260
00:19:57,133 --> 00:20:00,219
Good morning. I hope you
haven't been waiting too long.

261
00:20:00,469 --> 00:20:03,056
No problem. We had time
to grab a bite to eat.

262
00:20:03,307 --> 00:20:06,143
Good. Glad you made it
before they shut down the kitchen.

263
00:20:06,394 --> 00:20:08,062
Is your family
having a look around?

264
00:20:08,313 --> 00:20:11,650
No, my son's
discovered the games room.

265
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,945
- Has your luggage been brought in?
- Right there.

266
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:17,448
In view of all we have
to cover today...

267
00:20:17,699 --> 00:20:21,328
...I suggest we have a quick look
at your apartment and get started.

268
00:20:21,578 --> 00:20:24,331
Have the Torrances' things
brought to their apartment.

269
00:20:24,581 --> 00:20:27,293
I'd better collect my family first.

270
00:20:35,385 --> 00:20:37,763
This is our Colorado Lounge.

271
00:20:38,013 --> 00:20:40,390
It's beautiful.

272
00:20:40,849 --> 00:20:42,644
My God!

273
00:20:42,894 --> 00:20:45,396
This place is fantastic,
isn't it, hon?

274
00:20:45,647 --> 00:20:46,981
It sure is.

275
00:20:47,003 --> 00:20:49,802
I've never seen anything
like this before.

276
00:20:51,443 --> 00:20:53,411
Are all these
Indian designs authentic?

277
00:20:53,611 --> 00:20:55,044
I believe they're based...

278
00:20:55,246 --> 00:20:58,444
...mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.

279
00:20:58,651 --> 00:21:00,619
They're really gorgeous.

280
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,844
As a matter of fact...

281
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:05,149
...this is probably the most
gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.

282
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:08,528
This old place has had
an illustrious past.

283
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:11,823
In its heyday, it was a stopping
place for the jet setters...

284
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:15,003
...even before anybody knew
what a jet set was.

285
00:21:15,204 --> 00:21:18,264
We had four presidents
who stayed here.

286
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,802
Lots of movie stars.

287
00:21:20,008 --> 00:21:21,567
Royalty?

288
00:21:21,945 --> 00:21:23,344
All the best people.

289
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:19,720
This is the staff wing
of the hotel.

290
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:24,017
None of the other bedrooms
are heated during the winter.

291
00:22:24,267 --> 00:22:27,145
- Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
- Goodbye, girls.

292
00:22:27,395 --> 00:22:29,314
And here are your quarters.

293
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:32,360
Living room, bedroom, bathroom.

294
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:35,155
And a small bedroom for your son.

295
00:22:38,701 --> 00:22:40,745
Perfect for a child.

296
00:22:47,277 --> 00:22:50,735
Well, then. Place is
very nicely self-contained.

297
00:22:50,949 --> 00:22:52,507
Easy to keep.

298
00:22:55,287 --> 00:22:56,345
Cozy.

299
00:22:56,555 --> 00:22:58,819
Yes, very cozy for a family.

300
00:22:59,058 --> 00:23:00,719
If you feel like spreading out...

301
00:23:00,926 --> 00:23:03,589
...you have the rest of the hotel
to move around in.

302
00:23:05,232 --> 00:23:07,723
Well, it's very...

303
00:23:08,268 --> 00:23:09,566
...homey.

304
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,738
This is our famous hedge maze.

305
00:23:14,943 --> 00:23:19,244
It's quite an attraction here.
The walls are 13 feet high...

306
00:23:19,449 --> 00:23:21,747
...and the hedge is as old
as the hotel itself.

307
00:23:21,951 --> 00:23:24,579
A lot of fun, but I wouldn't
want to go in there...

308
00:23:24,788 --> 00:23:27,780
...unless I had an hour
to spare to find my way out.

309
00:23:29,193 --> 00:23:31,286
When was the Overlook built?

310
00:23:32,297 --> 00:23:34,528
Construction started in 1907.

311
00:23:34,734 --> 00:23:36,702
It was finished in 1909.

312
00:23:36,902 --> 00:23:39,564
The site's supposed to be
on an Indian burial ground.

313
00:23:39,772 --> 00:23:41,400
They actually had to repel...

314
00:23:41,608 --> 00:23:44,509
...a few Indian attacks as they
were building it.

315
00:23:45,112 --> 00:23:47,012
That's our Snowcat.

316
00:23:47,714 --> 00:23:49,740
Can you both drive a car?

317
00:23:50,285 --> 00:23:53,846
That's fine. Basically the Snowcat
operates very much like a car.

318
00:23:54,056 --> 00:23:56,617
It won't take you long
to get the hang of it.

319
00:23:57,827 --> 00:24:01,194
As a matter of fact, we brought
a decorator in from Chicago...

320
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,527
...just last year to refurbish
this part of the hotel.

321
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,702
He sure did a beautiful job.

322
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:09,235
Pink and gold
are my favorite colors.

323
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,407
This is our Gold Ballroom.

324
00:24:13,979 --> 00:24:15,241
I'll say!

325
00:24:15,447 --> 00:24:19,213
We can accommodate up to
300 people here very comfortably.

326
00:24:19,752 --> 00:24:22,619
Boy, we could really have
a good party in this room.

327
00:24:22,822 --> 00:24:26,622
I'm afraid you won't do too well
here unless you brought supplies.

328
00:24:26,826 --> 00:24:29,887
We remove the booze from
the premises when we shut down.

329
00:24:30,097 --> 00:24:33,157
That reduces the insurance
we normally have to carry.

330
00:24:33,368 --> 00:24:34,335
We don't drink.

331
00:24:34,536 --> 00:24:35,970
Then you're in luck.

332
00:24:36,172 --> 00:24:40,404
Dick, come on over and say hello
to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.

333
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:42,737
This is Dick Hallorann,
our head chef.

334
00:24:42,946 --> 00:24:45,676
Mr. Hallorann, I'm Jack.
This is my wife, Winifred.

335
00:24:45,882 --> 00:24:47,076
Glad to meet you.

336
00:24:47,284 --> 00:24:50,151
The Torrances will take care
of the Overlook this winter.

337
00:24:50,354 --> 00:24:54,086
That's just great. How do you
folks like our hotel so far?

338
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:56,158
It's just wonderful.

339
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:57,886
Hi, Danny!

340
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:01,494
I found him outside
looking for you.

341
00:25:02,702 --> 00:25:05,569
Did you get tired
of bombing the universe?

342
00:25:06,974 --> 00:25:08,464
Come on over here.

343
00:25:08,676 --> 00:25:09,836
Thank you, Susie.

344
00:25:10,044 --> 00:25:14,038
I think it'd be good if you could
show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen...

345
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,115
...while I continue on with Jack.

346
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:18,753
It would be a pleasure.
Right this way.

347
00:25:18,955 --> 00:25:20,513
Great. See you later, hon.

348
00:25:20,723 --> 00:25:22,089
Bye, darling.

349
00:25:24,461 --> 00:25:27,794
Mrs. Torrance, your husband
introduced you as Winifred.

350
00:25:27,998 --> 00:25:30,524
Now, are you a "Winnie",
or a "Freddie"?

351
00:25:30,735 --> 00:25:31,997
I'm a Wendy.

352
00:25:32,203 --> 00:25:35,400
Wendy. That's nice.
That's the prettiest.

353
00:25:35,608 --> 00:25:37,235
This is the kitchen, huh?

354
00:25:37,444 --> 00:25:39,036
This is it.

355
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:42,181
How do you like it, Danny?
Is it big enough for you?

356
00:25:43,016 --> 00:25:45,212
It's the biggest place I ever seen.

357
00:25:45,453 --> 00:25:47,785
This whole place
is such an enormous maze.

358
00:25:47,989 --> 00:25:51,550
I'll have to leave a trail of
breadcrumbs every time I come in.

359
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,326
Don't let it get you down.

360
00:25:54,531 --> 00:25:57,021
It's big, but it ain't
nothing but a kitchen.

361
00:25:57,232 --> 00:25:59,427
A lot of this stuff
you'll never have to touch.

362
00:25:59,635 --> 00:26:01,866
I wouldn't know
what to do with it if I did.

363
00:26:02,071 --> 00:26:05,199
One thing for sure, you don't
have to worry about food.

364
00:26:05,408 --> 00:26:10,073
You folks could eat here for a year
and never have the same menu twice.

365
00:26:10,281 --> 00:26:13,375
Right here is
our walk-in freezer.

366
00:26:14,518 --> 00:26:17,579
This is where we keep
all of our meat.

367
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,781
You got 15 rib roasts...

368
00:26:19,992 --> 00:26:22,119
...30 ten-pound bags of hamburger.

369
00:26:22,328 --> 00:26:25,389
We got 12 turkeys,
about 40 chickens...

370
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:28,693
...50 sirloin steaks,
two dozen of pork roast...

371
00:26:28,902 --> 00:26:31,872
...and 20 legs of lamb.
Do you like lamb, Doc?

372
00:26:33,107 --> 00:26:35,473
You don't?
What's your favorite food, then?

373
00:26:35,678 --> 00:26:37,543
French fries and ketchup.

374
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,272
I think we can
manage that too, Doc.

375
00:26:40,484 --> 00:26:42,213
Come along, now.
Watch your step.

376
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,518
How'd you know we call him Doc?

377
00:26:50,728 --> 00:26:54,755
- Beg your pardon?
- Doc. You called Danny "Doc" twice.

378
00:26:54,966 --> 00:26:56,366
I did?

379
00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:00,298
We call him Doc sometimes,
like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.

380
00:27:00,507 --> 00:27:01,769
But how did you know?

381
00:27:01,975 --> 00:27:04,501
I guess I probably
heard you call him that.

382
00:27:04,712 --> 00:27:06,976
It's possible.
But I honestly don't remember...

383
00:27:07,181 --> 00:27:09,376
...calling him that
since we've been with you.

384
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:11,779
Anyway, he looks
like a Doc, doesn't he?

385
00:27:13,221 --> 00:27:14,654
What's up, Doc?

386
00:27:16,492 --> 00:27:18,688
Now, this is the storeroom.

387
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,261
In here is where we keep...

388
00:27:22,466 --> 00:27:25,264
...all the dried goods
and the canned goods.

389
00:27:25,469 --> 00:27:27,904
We got canned fruits
and vegetables...

390
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:31,906
...canned fish and meats,
hot and cold cereals.

391
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:35,308
Post Toasties, Corn Flakes,
Sugar Puffs...

392
00:27:35,514 --> 00:27:39,541
...Rice Krispies, oatmeal,
Wheatena and Cream of Wheat.

393
00:27:39,786 --> 00:27:42,221
You got a dozen jugs
of black molasses.

394
00:27:42,423 --> 00:27:45,619
We got 60 boxes of dried milk...

395
00:27:53,267 --> 00:27:55,735
How'd you like some ice cream, Doc?

396
00:27:58,141 --> 00:28:00,132
Sociables, finger rolls...

397
00:28:00,343 --> 00:28:01,867
...and 7 kinds of what have you.

398
00:28:02,078 --> 00:28:05,606
Now, we've got dried peaches,
dried apricots...

399
00:28:05,816 --> 00:28:08,910
...dried raisins and dried prunes.

400
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:13,420
You know, you got to keep regular
if you want to be happy.

401
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:17,955
- How're you getting on?
- Fine.

402
00:28:18,164 --> 00:28:21,726
Can we borrow Mrs. Torrance?
We're on our way to the basement.

403
00:28:21,935 --> 00:28:23,869
I promise we won't
keep her very long.

404
00:28:24,071 --> 00:28:27,268
No problem, Mr. Ullman. I was just
getting to the ice cream.

405
00:28:27,474 --> 00:28:29,340
You like ice cream, Doc?

406
00:28:30,211 --> 00:28:31,178
I thought you did.

407
00:28:31,379 --> 00:28:34,439
You folks mind if I give Danny
some ice cream while we wait?

408
00:28:34,649 --> 00:28:36,480
- Not at all.
- We don't mind.

409
00:28:36,685 --> 00:28:38,880
- Good.
- Sound good to you, Doc?

410
00:28:39,089 --> 00:28:41,148
Okay, you behave yourself.

411
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,026
What kind of ice cream
do you like?

412
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,128
Chocolate.

413
00:28:47,331 --> 00:28:50,300
Chocolate it shall be.
Come on, son.

414
00:28:54,873 --> 00:28:56,864
It's amazing, all this
activity today.

415
00:28:57,075 --> 00:28:59,873
The guests and some staff
left yesterday, but the...

416
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,513
...last day's always hectic.

417
00:29:01,715 --> 00:29:04,775
Everybody wants to be on their way
as early as possible.

418
00:29:04,985 --> 00:29:09,013
By 5:00 tonight, you'll never
know anybody was ever here.

419
00:29:09,224 --> 00:29:11,283
Just like a ghost ship, huh?

420
00:29:16,966 --> 00:29:19,935
Do you know how I knew
your name was Doc?

421
00:29:26,511 --> 00:29:28,911
You know what I'm
talking about, don't you?

422
00:29:35,887 --> 00:29:39,380
I can remember when I was
a little boy...

423
00:29:39,793 --> 00:29:42,318
...my grandmother and I
could hold conversations...

424
00:29:42,529 --> 00:29:46,363
...entirely without ever
opening our mouths.

425
00:29:47,435 --> 00:29:49,733
She called it "shining."

426
00:29:51,238 --> 00:29:53,968
And for a long time I thought
it was just the two of us...

427
00:29:54,175 --> 00:29:56,804
...that had "the shine" to us.

428
00:29:57,412 --> 00:30:00,404
Just like you probably thought
you was the only one.

429
00:30:01,084 --> 00:30:02,950
But there are other folks...

430
00:30:03,153 --> 00:30:06,884
...though mostly they don't
know it, or don't believe it.

431
00:30:11,563 --> 00:30:13,997
How long have you
been able to do it?

432
00:30:19,205 --> 00:30:21,605
Why don't you want
to talk about it?

433
00:30:26,848 --> 00:30:28,907
I'm not supposed to.

434
00:30:30,485 --> 00:30:33,010
Who says you ain't supposed to?

435
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:37,857
Tony.

436
00:30:39,828 --> 00:30:41,490
Who's Tony?

437
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:47,369
Tony's the little boy
that lives in my mouth.

438
00:30:49,307 --> 00:30:51,332
Is Tony the one
that...

439
00:30:51,543 --> 00:30:53,101
...tells you things?

440
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:00,016
How does he tell you things?

441
00:31:01,855 --> 00:31:06,156
It's like I go to sleep,
and he shows me things.

442
00:31:06,361 --> 00:31:10,457
But when I wake up,
I can't remember everything.

443
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,998
Does your mom and dad
know about Tony?

444
00:31:19,308 --> 00:31:21,869
Do they know he tells you things?

445
00:31:22,746 --> 00:31:25,681
Tony told me never to tell them.

446
00:31:27,818 --> 00:31:31,186
Has Tony ever told you
anything about this place?

447
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,949
About the Overlook Hotel?

448
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:38,787
I don't know.

449
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:42,496
Now think real hard, Doc.

450
00:31:42,702 --> 00:31:43,727
Think.

451
00:31:46,841 --> 00:31:49,571
Maybe he showed me something.

452
00:31:50,511 --> 00:31:53,140
Try to think of what it was.

453
00:31:56,151 --> 00:31:59,451
Mr. Hallorann, are you scared
of this place?

454
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:04,788
Scared of nothing here.

455
00:32:05,262 --> 00:32:06,752
It's just that...

456
00:32:07,498 --> 00:32:10,331
...you know, some places
are like people.

457
00:32:11,169 --> 00:32:12,864
Some shine...

458
00:32:13,071 --> 00:32:14,470
...and some don't.

459
00:32:15,708 --> 00:32:17,835
I guess you could say
the Overlook Hotel...

460
00:32:18,043 --> 00:32:21,342
...has something about it
that's like shining.

461
00:32:24,385 --> 00:32:26,785
Is there something bad here?

462
00:32:38,401 --> 00:32:40,835
You know, Doc,
when something happens...

463
00:32:41,037 --> 00:32:44,666
...it can leave a trace
of itself behind.

464
00:32:45,442 --> 00:32:47,001
Say, like...

465
00:32:47,212 --> 00:32:50,272
...if someone burns toast.

466
00:32:52,384 --> 00:32:57,049
Maybe things that happen
leave other kind of traces behind.

467
00:32:58,224 --> 00:33:01,661
Not things that anyone
can notice.

468
00:33:01,862 --> 00:33:06,663
But things that people
who shine can see.

469
00:33:07,769 --> 00:33:11,069
Just like they can see things
that haven't happened yet...

470
00:33:13,341 --> 00:33:17,506
...sometimes they can see things
that happened a long time ago.

471
00:33:19,048 --> 00:33:21,915
I think a lot of things
happened right here...

472
00:33:22,117 --> 00:33:25,815
...in this particular hotel
over the years.

473
00:33:26,357 --> 00:33:28,757
And not all of them
was good.

474
00:33:32,063 --> 00:33:34,692
What about room 237?

475
00:33:38,036 --> 00:33:40,231
Room 237?

476
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:44,635
You're scared of room 237,
ain't you?

477
00:33:46,413 --> 00:33:47,880
No, I ain't.

478
00:33:49,384 --> 00:33:53,218
Mr. Hallorann, what is in room 237?

479
00:33:54,556 --> 00:33:55,921
Nothing.

480
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:59,590
There ain't nothing in room 237.

481
00:33:59,795 --> 00:34:03,026
But you ain't got no business
going in there anyway.

482
00:34:03,232 --> 00:34:05,360
So stay out.

483
00:34:05,569 --> 00:34:08,060
You understand? Stay out!

484
00:35:47,454 --> 00:35:49,183
Good morning, hon.

485
00:35:51,192 --> 00:35:52,955
Your breakfast is ready.

486
00:35:53,729 --> 00:35:55,356
What time is it?

487
00:35:55,564 --> 00:35:57,429
It's about 11:30.

488
00:35:59,335 --> 00:36:00,928
Jesus.

489
00:36:01,872 --> 00:36:04,306
I guess we've been
staying up too late.

490
00:36:04,608 --> 00:36:06,041
I know it.

491
00:36:07,344 --> 00:36:10,212
I made them just the way
you like them, sunny-side up.

492
00:36:10,516 --> 00:36:12,074
Nice.

493
00:36:14,353 --> 00:36:16,150
It's really pretty outside.

494
00:36:16,355 --> 00:36:19,587
How about taking me for a walk
after you finish your breakfast?

495
00:36:20,193 --> 00:36:24,528
I suppose I ought to try
to do some writing first.

496
00:36:25,966 --> 00:36:27,627
Any ideas yet?

497
00:36:28,636 --> 00:36:30,297
Lots of ideas.

498
00:36:30,505 --> 00:36:32,029
No good ones.

499
00:36:32,508 --> 00:36:34,976
Something will come.

500
00:36:35,478 --> 00:36:39,414
It's just a matter of settling into
the habit of writing every day.

501
00:36:40,984 --> 00:36:42,679
That's all it is.

502
00:36:44,788 --> 00:36:47,086
It's really nice up here,
isn't it?

503
00:36:47,491 --> 00:36:48,925
I love it.

504
00:36:49,427 --> 00:36:51,018
I really do.

505
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:54,956
I've never been this happy
or comfortable anywhere.

506
00:36:55,166 --> 00:36:58,933
It's amazing how fast you get
used to such a big place.

507
00:36:59,138 --> 00:37:02,039
I tell you, when we first
came up here...

508
00:37:02,241 --> 00:37:04,301
...I thought it was kind of scary.

509
00:37:04,744 --> 00:37:07,304
I fell in love with it right away.

510
00:37:07,981 --> 00:37:10,779
When I came up here
for my interview...

511
00:37:11,153 --> 00:37:14,987
...it was as though
I'd been here before.

512
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,818
I mean, we all have moments
of deja vu...

513
00:37:18,026 --> 00:37:20,222
...but this was ridiculous.

514
00:37:20,964 --> 00:37:22,829
It was almost as though I knew...

515
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:26,764
...what was going to be
around every corner.

516
00:37:59,909 --> 00:38:03,106
The loser has to keep
America clean. How's that?

517
00:38:03,313 --> 00:38:05,874
- All right.
- And you're going to lose.

518
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:09,211
And I'm going to get you.
You'd better run fast!

519
00:38:14,227 --> 00:38:15,353
Look out!

520
00:38:15,561 --> 00:38:17,426
I'm coming in close.

521
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:20,121
Loser has to keep America clean.

522
00:38:20,366 --> 00:38:21,994
Keep America clean.

523
00:38:23,003 --> 00:38:24,470
Danny, you win.

524
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:27,137
Let's take the rest
of this walking.

525
00:38:29,678 --> 00:38:31,077
Give me your hand.

526
00:38:33,716 --> 00:38:35,513
Isn't it beautiful?

527
00:38:53,272 --> 00:38:54,637
Dead end.

528
00:39:52,106 --> 00:39:53,733
We made it.

529
00:39:54,243 --> 00:39:55,472
Isn't it beautiful?

530
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:19,002
It's so pretty.

531
00:40:23,577 --> 00:40:26,547
I didn't think it was
going to be this big. Did you?

532
00:40:37,827 --> 00:40:40,227
Rutherford was serving
a life sentence...

533
00:40:40,429 --> 00:40:42,193
...for a 1968 shooting.

534
00:40:42,399 --> 00:40:46,267
And the search continues
for that missing Aspen woman.

535
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:49,838
24-year-old Susan Robertson
has been missing 10 days.

536
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:52,771
She disappeared on a hunting
trip with her husband.

537
00:40:52,977 --> 00:40:55,775
They may have to
call off the search...

538
00:40:55,981 --> 00:40:58,507
...if a predicted snowstorm
moves in tomorrow.

539
00:40:58,718 --> 00:41:00,583
It's so beautiful
in Denver today...

540
00:41:00,787 --> 00:41:02,914
...it's hard to believe
a snowstorm could be close.

541
00:41:03,122 --> 00:41:05,353
I want to go outside
and lie in the sun...

542
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:09,689
...yet to our north, to our west,
it is snowing and cold.

543
00:41:09,897 --> 00:41:11,091
And it's moving...

544
00:41:11,298 --> 00:41:14,462
...right here towards Colorado
as we talk. It's incredible.

545
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:44,543
Hi, hon.

546
00:43:48,149 --> 00:43:49,549
How's it going?

547
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,280
Fine.

548
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:56,949
Get a lot written today?

549
00:44:04,001 --> 00:44:06,561
The weather forecast
said it's going to snow tonight.

550
00:44:11,775 --> 00:44:14,108
What do you want me
to do about it?

551
00:44:16,247 --> 00:44:18,408
Come on, hon.

552
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:20,776
Don't be so grouchy.

553
00:44:21,188 --> 00:44:22,519
I'm not...

554
00:44:22,889 --> 00:44:24,083
...being grouchy.

555
00:44:24,291 --> 00:44:27,089
I just want to finish my work.

556
00:44:30,598 --> 00:44:32,998
Okay. I understand.

557
00:44:33,234 --> 00:44:35,829
I'll come back later
with a couple of sandwiches.

558
00:44:36,038 --> 00:44:38,506
Maybe you'll let me
read something then.

559
00:44:41,711 --> 00:44:42,803
Wendy...

560
00:44:43,012 --> 00:44:45,607
...let me explain something to you.

561
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:50,385
When you come in and interrupt,
you're breaking my concentration.

562
00:44:50,588 --> 00:44:52,022
You're distracting me...

563
00:44:52,224 --> 00:44:55,660
...and it will then take me time
to get back to where I was.

564
00:44:55,861 --> 00:44:57,294
Understand?

565
00:45:00,767 --> 00:45:01,927
Fine.

566
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,832
We're going to make a new rule:

567
00:45:05,038 --> 00:45:06,471
Whenever I'm in here...

568
00:45:06,674 --> 00:45:08,938
...and you hear me typing...

569
00:45:10,745 --> 00:45:13,680
...or whatever the fuck
you hear me doing in here...

570
00:45:13,882 --> 00:45:16,181
...when I'm in here,
that means I am working.

571
00:45:16,385 --> 00:45:18,615
That means don't come in.

572
00:45:18,821 --> 00:45:21,085
Now, do you think
you can handle that?

573
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:26,856
Fine.

574
00:45:27,899 --> 00:45:31,199
Why don't you start right now
and get the fuck out of here?

575
00:46:07,144 --> 00:46:08,509
All right, you!

576
00:46:09,948 --> 00:46:11,745
I know you've got more.

577
00:46:13,852 --> 00:46:14,910
Missed!

578
00:46:20,492 --> 00:46:21,322
Don't have!

579
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,289
No fair anymore.

580
00:47:31,976 --> 00:47:33,273
I knew it.

581
00:48:03,545 --> 00:48:07,038
This is KDK 12 calling KDK 1.

582
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:13,250
KDK 12 to KDK 1.

583
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:16,586
This is KDK 1.
We're receiving you. Over.

584
00:48:16,961 --> 00:48:20,089
Hi, this is Wendy Torrance
at the Overlook Hotel.

585
00:48:20,665 --> 00:48:23,464
Hi, how are you folks
getting on up there? Over.

586
00:48:23,736 --> 00:48:25,067
We're just fine.

587
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:27,738
But our telephones
aren't doing too well.

588
00:48:27,941 --> 00:48:30,968
Are the lines down,
by any chance? Over.

589
00:48:31,612 --> 00:48:35,412
Yes, quite a few of them are down
due to the storm. Over.

590
00:48:35,716 --> 00:48:38,914
Any chance of them
being repaired soon? Over.

591
00:48:39,121 --> 00:48:40,281
Well, I wouldn't like to say.

592
00:48:40,489 --> 00:48:43,925
Most winters they stay that way
until spring. Over.

593
00:48:44,426 --> 00:48:47,828
Boy, this storm is really something,
isn't it? Over.

594
00:48:48,298 --> 00:48:51,199
Yes. It's one of the worst we've
had for years.

595
00:48:51,769 --> 00:48:54,967
Is there anything else we can
do for you, Mrs. Torrance?

596
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,601
I suppose not. Over.

597
00:48:58,209 --> 00:49:01,509
If you folks have any problems
up there, just give us a call.

598
00:49:01,714 --> 00:49:03,011
And, Mrs. Torrance?

599
00:49:03,215 --> 00:49:07,413
It might be a good idea if you
leave your radio on all the time.

600
00:49:08,256 --> 00:49:09,746
Okay. We'll do that.

601
00:49:09,957 --> 00:49:12,016
It was real nice talking to you.

602
00:49:12,226 --> 00:49:14,854
Bye. Over and out.

603
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:51,965
Hello, Danny.

604
00:49:57,245 --> 00:49:59,679
Come and play with us.

605
00:50:04,553 --> 00:50:07,317
Come and play with us, Danny.

606
00:50:09,159 --> 00:50:11,025
Forever...

607
00:50:12,797 --> 00:50:14,560
...and ever...

608
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,525
...and ever.

609
00:50:49,005 --> 00:50:50,633
Tony...

610
00:50:51,643 --> 00:50:53,668
...I'm scared.

611
00:50:59,151 --> 00:51:02,712
Remember what Mr. Hallorann said.

612
00:51:04,323 --> 00:51:08,226
It's just like
pictures in a book, Danny.

613
00:51:08,428 --> 00:51:10,589
It isn't real.

614
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:23,090
Please let me give you
some money.

615
00:51:23,294 --> 00:51:25,319
I wouldn't think of it.

616
00:51:25,563 --> 00:51:26,825
Well, how can I repay you?

617
00:51:27,799 --> 00:51:29,700
It's okay. Really.

618
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,430
Well, I'm going to have
some coffee.

619
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:34,163
Would you like some?

620
00:51:35,909 --> 00:51:36,968
Sure.

621
00:51:37,178 --> 00:51:39,043
Great. Sit down.

622
00:51:48,957 --> 00:51:51,585
Marvelous doughnuts.
Help yourself.

623
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:55,664
Coffee will be ready
in a few minutes.

624
00:51:59,436 --> 00:52:02,770
Can I go up to my room
and get my fire engine?

625
00:52:04,209 --> 00:52:06,939
Not right now.
Daddy's asleep.

626
00:52:07,914 --> 00:52:10,075
I won't make any noise.

627
00:52:11,485 --> 00:52:13,385
Now come on, Doc.

628
00:52:13,587 --> 00:52:15,282
He only went to bed
a few hours ago.

629
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:17,287
Can't you wait till later?

630
00:52:17,492 --> 00:52:20,620
I won't make a sound.
I promise I'll tiptoe.

631
00:52:23,832 --> 00:52:25,129
All right.

632
00:52:25,334 --> 00:52:27,734
But really don't make a sound.

633
00:52:27,937 --> 00:52:29,427
I won't, Mom.

634
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:31,969
Make sure you
come right back...

635
00:52:32,176 --> 00:52:34,167
...because I'm going to
make lunch soon.

636
00:52:36,314 --> 00:52:37,804
Okay, Mom.

637
00:53:27,072 --> 00:53:30,235
Can I go to my room
and get my fire engine?

638
00:53:33,981 --> 00:53:36,176
Come here for a minute first.

639
00:54:13,193 --> 00:54:14,990
How's it going, Doc?

640
00:54:19,567 --> 00:54:21,365
Having a good time?

641
00:54:23,439 --> 00:54:24,906
Yes, Dad.

642
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:29,039
Good.

643
00:54:31,247 --> 00:54:33,408
I want you to
have a good time.

644
00:54:34,117 --> 00:54:35,745
I am, Dad.

645
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:47,996
Do you feel bad?

646
00:54:53,941 --> 00:54:56,239
I'm just a little bit tired.

647
00:54:57,812 --> 00:55:00,372
Then why don't you
go to sleep?

648
00:55:03,952 --> 00:55:05,510
I can't.

649
00:55:06,989 --> 00:55:09,287
I got too much to do.

650
00:55:18,603 --> 00:55:20,867
Do you like this hotel?

651
00:55:26,879 --> 00:55:28,278
I do.

652
00:55:29,248 --> 00:55:30,580
I love it.

653
00:55:32,786 --> 00:55:34,117
Don't you?

654
00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:37,980
I guess so.

655
00:55:40,629 --> 00:55:41,823
Good.

656
00:55:45,033 --> 00:55:47,366
I want you to like it here.

657
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:54,742
I wish we could stay here
forever...

658
00:55:54,945 --> 00:55:56,742
...and ever...

659
00:55:57,415 --> 00:55:58,746
...and ever.

660
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:05,214
What?

661
00:56:06,492 --> 00:56:09,587
You would never hurt Mommy or me,
would you?

662
00:56:15,068 --> 00:56:16,558
What do you mean?

663
00:56:21,677 --> 00:56:24,271
Did your mother ever
say that to you?

664
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:26,745
That I would hurt you?

665
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:28,882
No, Dad.

666
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,613
You sure?

667
00:56:33,157 --> 00:56:34,715
Yes, Dad.

668
00:56:39,531 --> 00:56:41,557
I love you, Danny.

669
00:56:42,768 --> 00:56:45,362
I love you
more than anything else...

670
00:56:45,571 --> 00:56:48,131
...in the whole world...

671
00:56:48,909 --> 00:56:51,968
...and I would never do anything
to hurt you...

672
00:56:52,278 --> 00:56:53,506
...never.

673
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:56,440
You know that, don't you?

674
00:56:56,917 --> 00:56:58,475
Yes, Dad.

675
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:00,512
Good.

676
00:58:28,458 --> 00:58:30,222
Mom, are you in there?

677
00:59:49,486 --> 00:59:50,544
What happened?

678
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:51,982
Honey...

679
00:59:52,856 --> 00:59:54,255
...what's wrong?

680
01:00:02,434 --> 01:00:03,834
I had the most...

681
01:00:04,037 --> 01:00:06,631
...terrible nightmare I ever had.

682
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:11,511
- It was the most horrible dream.
- It's okay, it's okay now.

683
01:00:12,713 --> 01:00:14,078
Really.

684
01:00:18,352 --> 01:00:19,945
I dreamed that I...

685
01:00:20,155 --> 01:00:22,589
...that I killed
you and Danny.

686
01:00:25,328 --> 01:00:27,558
But I didn't just kill you.

687
01:00:28,865 --> 01:00:31,629
I cut you up
into little pieces.

688
01:00:34,304 --> 01:00:35,828
My God.

689
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:39,100
I must be losing my mind.

690
01:00:41,378 --> 01:00:44,007
Everything's going to be
all right.

691
01:00:46,118 --> 01:00:48,814
Come on. Let's get up
off the floor.

692
01:00:56,663 --> 01:00:58,962
There. Now sit up.

693
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:00,897
It's okay.

694
01:01:02,003 --> 01:01:03,436
It's okay.

695
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:08,704
Danny!

696
01:01:09,012 --> 01:01:10,946
Everything's okay!

697
01:01:11,147 --> 01:01:14,311
Just go play in your room
for a while.

698
01:01:14,652 --> 01:01:16,711
Your dad's just got
a headache.

699
01:01:18,022 --> 01:01:21,049
Danny, mind what I say.
Go play in your room.

700
01:01:23,028 --> 01:01:25,963
Honey, let me just go
get him out of here.

701
01:01:26,165 --> 01:01:27,689
I'll be right back.

702
01:01:29,603 --> 01:01:31,662
Why don't you mind me?

703
01:01:38,279 --> 01:01:40,110
Oh, my God.

704
01:01:41,316 --> 01:01:43,716
What happened to your neck?

705
01:01:45,655 --> 01:01:47,782
What happened to your neck?

706
01:02:16,757 --> 01:02:18,725
You did this to him...

707
01:02:19,159 --> 01:02:20,592
...didn't you?!

708
01:02:22,429 --> 01:02:24,489
You son of a bitch!

709
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:26,564
You did this to him!

710
01:02:26,769 --> 01:02:28,202
Didn't you?!

711
01:02:29,538 --> 01:02:31,200
How could you?!

712
01:02:31,441 --> 01:02:33,170
How could you?!

713
01:04:03,048 --> 01:04:06,142
God! I'd give anything
for a drink.

714
01:04:08,788 --> 01:04:11,689
I'd give my goddamn soul...

715
01:04:11,891 --> 01:04:14,383
...for just a glass of beer.

716
01:04:29,379 --> 01:04:30,869
Hi, Lloyd.

717
01:04:34,418 --> 01:04:36,819
A little slow tonight,
isn't it?

718
01:04:41,692 --> 01:04:43,957
Yes it is, Mr. Torrance.

719
01:04:46,031 --> 01:04:47,498
What will it be?

720
01:04:49,169 --> 01:04:52,139
I'm awfully glad
you asked me that, Lloyd...

721
01:04:52,339 --> 01:04:55,672
...because I just happen to have
two twenties...

722
01:04:55,876 --> 01:04:58,777
...and two tens
right here in my wallet.

723
01:04:58,979 --> 01:05:02,245
I was afraid they were
going to be there until next April.

724
01:05:02,951 --> 01:05:04,782
So here's what:

725
01:05:05,087 --> 01:05:07,386
You slip me a bottle of bourbon...

726
01:05:07,590 --> 01:05:10,388
...a little glass and some ice.

727
01:05:10,594 --> 01:05:12,619
You can do that,
can't you, Lloyd?

728
01:05:13,063 --> 01:05:15,430
You're not too busy, are you?

729
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,491
No, sir.
I'm not busy at all.

730
01:05:19,003 --> 01:05:20,561
Good man.

731
01:05:20,872 --> 01:05:21,964
You set them up...

732
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:25,108
...and I'll knock them back,
one by one.

733
01:05:26,245 --> 01:05:29,180
White man's burden,
Lloyd, my man.

734
01:05:29,381 --> 01:05:31,543
White man's burden.

735
01:05:37,625 --> 01:05:38,752
Say, Lloyd...

736
01:05:38,961 --> 01:05:41,725
...it seems I'm temporarily light.

737
01:05:42,064 --> 01:05:44,498
How's my credit
in this joint, anyway?

738
01:05:44,766 --> 01:05:47,133
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.

739
01:05:47,837 --> 01:05:49,464
That's swell.

740
01:05:49,672 --> 01:05:51,367
I like you, Lloyd.

741
01:05:51,575 --> 01:05:53,236
I always liked you.

742
01:05:53,444 --> 01:05:55,776
You were always the best of them.

743
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:58,346
Best goddamned bartender...

744
01:05:58,549 --> 01:06:01,484
...from Timbuktu
to Portland, Maine.

745
01:06:01,686 --> 01:06:03,916
Or Portland, Oregon,
for that matter.

746
01:06:04,189 --> 01:06:05,986
Thank you for saying so.

747
01:06:08,293 --> 01:06:12,822
Here's to 5 miserable months
on the wagon...

748
01:06:13,033 --> 01:06:17,094
...and all the irreparable harm
that it's caused me.

749
01:06:35,326 --> 01:06:37,794
How are things going,
Mr. Torrance?

750
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:41,725
Things could be better.

751
01:06:43,235 --> 01:06:45,999
Things could be
a whole lot better.

752
01:06:46,872 --> 01:06:49,205
I hope it's nothing serious.

753
01:06:52,213 --> 01:06:54,204
Nothing serious.

754
01:06:55,849 --> 01:06:58,410
Just a little problem with...

755
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:01,748
...the old sperm bank
upstairs.

756
01:07:01,957 --> 01:07:04,324
Nothing I can't handle,
though.

757
01:07:04,527 --> 01:07:06,222
Thanks.

758
01:07:06,696 --> 01:07:07,685
Women.

759
01:07:07,897 --> 01:07:09,421
Can't live with them...

760
01:07:09,632 --> 01:07:11,463
...can't live without them.

761
01:07:14,672 --> 01:07:16,230
Words of wisdom, Lloyd.

762
01:07:16,441 --> 01:07:17,908
Words of...

763
01:07:18,109 --> 01:07:19,634
...wisdom.

764
01:07:31,157 --> 01:07:34,388
I never laid a hand on him,
goddamn it.

765
01:07:34,595 --> 01:07:36,223
I didn't.

766
01:07:38,267 --> 01:07:42,863
I wouldn't touch one hair
on his goddamn little head.

767
01:07:43,472 --> 01:07:46,600
I love the little
son of a bitch.

768
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:51,044
I'd do anything for him.

769
01:07:51,247 --> 01:07:54,045
Any fucking thing for him.

770
01:07:58,122 --> 01:08:00,683
But that bitch!

771
01:08:01,693 --> 01:08:03,388
As long as I live...

772
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:07,064
...she'll never let me forget
what happened.

773
01:08:16,678 --> 01:08:19,511
I did hurt him once, okay?

774
01:08:19,881 --> 01:08:21,941
It was an accident.

775
01:08:22,251 --> 01:08:24,845
Completely unintentional.

776
01:08:26,121 --> 01:08:28,351
It could have happened
to anybody.

777
01:08:30,093 --> 01:08:33,551
And it was three goddamn
years ago!

778
01:08:33,763 --> 01:08:36,596
The little fucker had thrown all my
papers all over the floor.

779
01:08:36,801 --> 01:08:39,270
All I tried to do was pull him up.

780
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:46,740
A momentary loss of
muscular coordination.

781
01:08:47,046 --> 01:08:48,274
I mean...

782
01:08:48,815 --> 01:08:52,342
...a few extra foot-pounds
of energy...

783
01:08:52,552 --> 01:08:55,386
...per second, per second.

784
01:09:11,508 --> 01:09:13,408
Thank God you're here.

785
01:09:16,648 --> 01:09:18,843
There's someone else
in the hotel with us.

786
01:09:19,051 --> 01:09:21,576
There's a crazy woman
in one of the rooms.

787
01:09:21,787 --> 01:09:24,348
She tried to strangle Danny.

788
01:09:26,893 --> 01:09:29,293
Are you out of your fucking mind?

789
01:09:31,231 --> 01:09:33,256
It's the truth! Really.

790
01:09:33,466 --> 01:09:35,457
I swear it.
Danny told me.

791
01:09:35,803 --> 01:09:37,668
He went up into
one of the bedrooms.

792
01:09:37,872 --> 01:09:41,331
The door was open, and he saw this
crazy woman in the bathtub.

793
01:09:41,543 --> 01:09:43,875
She tried to strangle him!

794
01:09:47,582 --> 01:09:49,346
Which room was it?

795
01:09:56,995 --> 01:09:59,122
From Channel 10 in Miami...

796
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:01,696
...this is Newswatch
with Glen Rinker...

797
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:06,099
...Ann Bishop, and
the award-winning Newswatch team.

798
01:10:06,439 --> 01:10:08,873
Good evening. I'm Glen Rinker,
Newswatch Ten.

799
01:10:09,074 --> 01:10:12,203
As Miami continues to swelter
in a record winter heat wave...

800
01:10:12,412 --> 01:10:14,539
...bringing temperatures
to the 90s...

801
01:10:14,748 --> 01:10:17,876
...Central and Mountain states
are buried in snow.

802
01:10:18,085 --> 01:10:22,079
In Colorado, 10 inches of snow
fell injust a few hours tonight.

803
01:10:22,291 --> 01:10:24,521
Travel in the Rockies
is almost impossible.

804
01:10:24,726 --> 01:10:27,696
Airports are shut down, stranding
thousands of passengers.

805
01:10:27,897 --> 01:10:29,797
Highways are blocked
by snowdrifts.

806
01:10:29,999 --> 01:10:31,762
Railroad tracks are frozen.

807
01:10:31,968 --> 01:10:33,993
Officials in Colorado
tell Newswatch...

808
01:10:34,204 --> 01:10:37,766
...at least 3 have been killed
by exposure to freezing winds.

809
01:10:37,976 --> 01:10:40,274
The governor of Colorado
is expected...

810
01:10:40,479 --> 01:10:42,208
...to declare
a weather emergency.

811
01:10:42,415 --> 01:10:44,246
The National Guard
might be called out...

812
01:10:44,450 --> 01:10:45,644
...to clear streets and roads.

813
01:10:45,852 --> 01:10:48,082
Weather forecasters
predict more snow...

814
01:10:48,287 --> 01:10:50,279
...and heavy winds
tonight and tomorrow...

815
01:10:50,491 --> 01:10:53,119
...with temperatures dropping
well below zero.

816
01:10:53,327 --> 01:10:56,319
Back here in Florida,
we've got the opposite problem.

817
01:10:56,530 --> 01:10:58,761
The heat and humidity
are supposed to climb.

818
01:10:58,968 --> 01:11:00,936
Local beaches
should bejammed.

819
01:11:01,136 --> 01:11:03,161
Our weather expert,
Walter Cronice...

820
01:11:03,372 --> 01:11:06,638
...will have the local forecast
later on Newswatch.

821
01:16:38,329 --> 01:16:42,960
We're sorry. Your call cannot
be completed as dialed.

822
01:16:43,302 --> 01:16:46,430
If you need assistance,
please call the operator.

823
01:17:03,691 --> 01:17:05,523
Yes, it's me.

824
01:17:05,727 --> 01:17:07,160
Thank God.

825
01:17:11,834 --> 01:17:13,598
Did you find anything?

826
01:17:13,804 --> 01:17:16,534
No. Nothing at all.

827
01:17:17,141 --> 01:17:20,305
I didn't see one goddamn thing.

828
01:17:23,048 --> 01:17:26,540
You went into the room Danny said?
To 237?

829
01:17:26,752 --> 01:17:28,311
Yes, I did.

830
01:17:28,789 --> 01:17:30,586
And you didn't see anything at all?

831
01:17:30,791 --> 01:17:32,782
Absolutely nothing.

832
01:17:32,993 --> 01:17:34,255
How is he?

833
01:17:34,461 --> 01:17:36,259
He's still asleep.

834
01:17:36,664 --> 01:17:37,790
Good.

835
01:17:43,605 --> 01:17:46,699
I'm sure he'll be himself again
in the morning.

836
01:17:51,182 --> 01:17:53,673
Are you sure it was the right room?

837
01:17:53,884 --> 01:17:57,047
I mean, maybe Danny made a mistake.

838
01:17:57,254 --> 01:17:59,621
He must have gone in that room.

839
01:17:59,825 --> 01:18:02,487
The door was open,
the lights were on.

840
01:18:05,130 --> 01:18:07,463
I just don't understand it.

841
01:18:11,805 --> 01:18:14,832
What about those bruises
on his neck?

842
01:18:17,012 --> 01:18:19,344
Somebody did that to him.

843
01:18:27,623 --> 01:18:29,056
I think...

844
01:18:30,728 --> 01:18:33,288
...he did it to himself.

845
01:18:39,303 --> 01:18:40,531
No.

846
01:18:41,205 --> 01:18:43,230
That's not possible.

847
01:18:48,548 --> 01:18:52,211
Once you rule out his version
of what happened...

848
01:18:52,452 --> 01:18:55,047
...there is no other explanation.

849
01:18:55,523 --> 01:18:56,854
Is there?

850
01:18:59,226 --> 01:19:02,128
It wouldn't be that different
from the episode...

851
01:19:02,330 --> 01:19:05,697
...that he had before
we came up here.

852
01:19:05,901 --> 01:19:07,129
Would it?

853
01:19:15,045 --> 01:19:18,038
Whatever the explanation is...

854
01:19:21,486 --> 01:19:22,885
...I think we...

855
01:19:23,088 --> 01:19:25,819
...have to get Danny out of here.

856
01:19:30,597 --> 01:19:32,429
Get him out of here?

857
01:19:36,604 --> 01:19:38,333
You mean...

858
01:19:39,373 --> 01:19:41,342
...just leave the hotel?

859
01:19:50,321 --> 01:19:51,788
It is so...

860
01:19:51,989 --> 01:19:54,423
...typical of you to create
a problem like this...

861
01:19:54,625 --> 01:19:57,151
...when I finally have a chance
to accomplish something!

862
01:19:57,362 --> 01:19:59,922
When I'm really into my work!

863
01:20:00,132 --> 01:20:04,092
I could really write my own ticket
if I went back now, couldn't I?

864
01:20:04,303 --> 01:20:08,034
Shoveling out driveways,
work in a car wash.

865
01:20:08,241 --> 01:20:10,334
Any of that appeal to you?

866
01:20:11,546 --> 01:20:14,242
I have let you fuck up my life
so far...

867
01:20:14,449 --> 01:20:18,078
...but I am not going to let you
fuck this up.

868
01:21:36,010 --> 01:21:38,309
Good evening. Forest Service.

869
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,313
My name is Dick Hallorann.

870
01:21:40,515 --> 01:21:42,949
I'm the head chef at
the Overlook Hotel.

871
01:21:43,151 --> 01:21:45,279
Good evening.
What can I do for you?

872
01:21:45,488 --> 01:21:49,049
I've been trying to make
an urgent phone call up there...

873
01:21:49,259 --> 01:21:52,558
...but the operator said
that the phone lines are down.

874
01:21:52,764 --> 01:21:56,359
A lot of lines around here
are down due to the storm.

875
01:21:56,568 --> 01:21:59,230
I hate to put you through
any trouble...

876
01:21:59,437 --> 01:22:02,669
...but there's a family up there
all by themselves with a young kid.

877
01:22:02,875 --> 01:22:04,536
And with this storm
and everything...

878
01:22:04,744 --> 01:22:07,645
...I'd appreciate it if you'd give
them a call on your radio...

879
01:22:07,847 --> 01:22:09,839
...just to see if
everything's okay.

880
01:22:10,350 --> 01:22:11,647
I'll be glad to do that.

881
01:22:11,852 --> 01:22:14,650
Why don't you call me back
in about 20 minutes?

882
01:22:14,856 --> 01:22:16,881
Thank you very much.
I'll do that.

883
01:22:17,091 --> 01:22:18,524
All right, sir.

884
01:22:38,849 --> 01:22:40,818
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.

885
01:22:41,019 --> 01:22:42,486
Good evening.

886
01:23:07,049 --> 01:23:08,516
Hi, Lloyd.

887
01:23:08,718 --> 01:23:10,583
Been away, but now I'm back.

888
01:23:10,854 --> 01:23:12,583
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.

889
01:23:13,256 --> 01:23:14,245
It's good to see you.

890
01:23:14,458 --> 01:23:17,120
It's good to be back, Lloyd.

891
01:23:17,762 --> 01:23:19,492
What'll it be, sir?

892
01:23:20,299 --> 01:23:22,563
Hair of the dog that bit me.

893
01:23:23,969 --> 01:23:25,630
Bourbon on the rocks.

894
01:23:26,473 --> 01:23:27,872
That'll do her.

895
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:43,655
No charge to you, Mr. Torrance.

896
01:23:45,094 --> 01:23:47,062
No charge?

897
01:23:47,697 --> 01:23:49,689
Your money's no good here.

898
01:23:55,339 --> 01:23:57,068
Orders from the house.

899
01:24:00,279 --> 01:24:02,770
Orders from the house.

900
01:24:06,018 --> 01:24:08,009
Drink up, Mr. Torrance.

901
01:24:10,222 --> 01:24:14,751
I'm the kind of man likes to know
who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.

902
01:24:17,064 --> 01:24:19,999
It's not a matter that concerns you,
Mr. Torrance.

903
01:24:20,201 --> 01:24:22,136
At least, not at this point.

904
01:24:26,942 --> 01:24:29,343
Anything you say, Lloyd.

905
01:24:29,779 --> 01:24:31,770
Anything you say.

906
01:24:44,764 --> 01:24:47,232
Oh, dear! I'm so sorry, sir.

907
01:24:48,334 --> 01:24:49,801
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

908
01:24:50,002 --> 01:24:52,563
I've made an awful mess
of your jacket, sir.

909
01:24:53,807 --> 01:24:57,436
That's all right.
I've got plenty of jackets.

910
01:24:57,645 --> 01:25:00,444
I'm afraid it's advocaat, sir.
It tends to stain.

911
01:25:00,649 --> 01:25:01,775
Advocaat, is it?

912
01:25:01,984 --> 01:25:04,145
Yes, sir.
I think the best thing...

913
01:25:04,353 --> 01:25:06,548
...is to come along
to the gentlemen's room...

914
01:25:06,755 --> 01:25:09,281
...and we'll get
some water to it, sir.

915
01:25:10,126 --> 01:25:13,425
Looks like you might have got a
spot of it on yourself...

916
01:25:13,630 --> 01:25:14,619
...Jeevesy old boy.

917
01:25:14,831 --> 01:25:17,995
That doesn't matter, sir.
You're the important one.

918
01:25:18,303 --> 01:25:20,703
Awfully nice of you to say.

919
01:25:21,139 --> 01:25:24,007
Of course, I intended to change
my jacket this evening...

920
01:25:24,210 --> 01:25:26,474
...before the fish and
goose soiree.

921
01:25:26,679 --> 01:25:28,704
Very wise, sir. Very wise.

922
01:25:28,915 --> 01:25:30,246
Here. I'll just...

923
01:25:31,051 --> 01:25:33,315
...hold this for you there,
Jeevesy.

924
01:25:33,521 --> 01:25:35,318
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

925
01:25:36,357 --> 01:25:39,987
Let's see if we can improve this
with a little water, sir.

926
01:25:40,196 --> 01:25:41,458
All right. I'll just...

927
01:25:41,664 --> 01:25:45,862
...set my bourbon and advocaat
down right there.

928
01:25:46,435 --> 01:25:47,869
Won't keep you a moment.

929
01:25:48,071 --> 01:25:49,470
Fine.

930
01:25:52,543 --> 01:25:54,203
What do they call you,
Jeevesy?

931
01:25:54,411 --> 01:25:56,971
Grady, sir. Delbert Grady.

932
01:26:01,753 --> 01:26:02,584
Grady?

933
01:26:02,788 --> 01:26:04,119
Yes, sir.

934
01:26:05,291 --> 01:26:06,622
Delbert Grady.

935
01:26:06,825 --> 01:26:08,349
That's right, sir.

936
01:26:17,070 --> 01:26:18,504
Mr. Grady...

937
01:26:19,274 --> 01:26:21,367
...haven't I seen you
somewhere before?

938
01:26:21,577 --> 01:26:24,273
Why, no, sir. I don't believe so.

939
01:26:31,321 --> 01:26:33,152
It's coming off now, sir.

940
01:26:38,095 --> 01:26:39,653
Mr. Grady...

941
01:26:41,167 --> 01:26:43,635
...weren't you once
the caretaker here?

942
01:26:43,836 --> 01:26:46,634
Why, no, sir. I don't believe so.

943
01:26:49,676 --> 01:26:53,009
You a married man, are you,
Mr. Grady?

944
01:26:53,213 --> 01:26:54,043
Yes, sir.

945
01:26:54,247 --> 01:26:57,513
I have a wife and
two daughters, sir.

946
01:26:58,553 --> 01:27:00,077
And...

947
01:27:01,757 --> 01:27:03,019
...where are they now?

948
01:27:03,225 --> 01:27:07,287
They're somewhere around.
I'm not quite sure at the moment.

949
01:27:17,975 --> 01:27:20,376
You were the caretaker here.

950
01:27:21,848 --> 01:27:23,839
I recognize you.

951
01:27:25,218 --> 01:27:28,279
I saw your picture
in the newspapers.

952
01:27:28,722 --> 01:27:30,485
You...

953
01:27:30,958 --> 01:27:34,485
...chopped your wife and daughter
up into little bits.

954
01:27:34,995 --> 01:27:36,395
And...

955
01:27:37,032 --> 01:27:38,966
...then you blew your brains out.

956
01:27:48,878 --> 01:27:50,641
That's strange, sir.

957
01:27:51,648 --> 01:27:54,378
I don't have any recollection
of that at all.

958
01:27:58,055 --> 01:27:59,921
Mr. Grady...

959
01:28:00,358 --> 01:28:03,691
...you were the caretaker here.

960
01:28:11,504 --> 01:28:14,268
I'm sorry to differ with you, sir.

961
01:28:16,143 --> 01:28:17,872
But you...

962
01:28:18,612 --> 01:28:20,443
...are the caretaker.

963
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:25,620
You've always been the caretaker.

964
01:28:28,524 --> 01:28:30,356
I should know, sir.

965
01:28:31,795 --> 01:28:34,389
I've always been here.

966
01:28:52,619 --> 01:28:54,815
Did you know, Mr. Torrance...

967
01:28:55,056 --> 01:28:56,819
...that your son...

968
01:28:57,225 --> 01:28:59,921
...is attempting to bring
an outside party...

969
01:29:00,128 --> 01:29:02,324
...into this situation?

970
01:29:04,901 --> 01:29:06,596
Did you know that?

971
01:29:12,843 --> 01:29:14,936
He is, Mr. Torrance.

972
01:29:17,282 --> 01:29:18,442
Who?

973
01:29:20,685 --> 01:29:22,312
A nigger.

974
01:29:26,393 --> 01:29:27,792
A nigger?

975
01:29:30,531 --> 01:29:31,963
A nigger...

976
01:29:32,165 --> 01:29:33,258
...cook.

977
01:29:39,773 --> 01:29:41,036
How?

978
01:29:43,311 --> 01:29:45,074
Your son...

979
01:29:45,514 --> 01:29:48,313
...has a very great talent.

980
01:29:49,286 --> 01:29:52,778
I don't think you are aware
how great it is.

981
01:29:53,523 --> 01:29:56,755
But he is attempting to use
that very talent...

982
01:29:56,961 --> 01:29:58,929
...against your will.

983
01:30:07,473 --> 01:30:08,735
Well...

984
01:30:11,511 --> 01:30:14,572
...he is a very willful boy.

985
01:30:16,984 --> 01:30:19,385
Indeed he is, Mr. Torrance.

986
01:30:19,588 --> 01:30:22,489
A very willful boy.

987
01:30:22,691 --> 01:30:24,022
A rather...

988
01:30:24,226 --> 01:30:25,750
...naughty boy...

989
01:30:25,962 --> 01:30:29,160
...if I may be so bold, sir.

990
01:30:36,407 --> 01:30:38,170
It's his mother.

991
01:30:40,311 --> 01:30:41,778
She...

992
01:30:41,980 --> 01:30:43,972
...interferes.

993
01:30:47,087 --> 01:30:50,181
Perhaps they need a good...

994
01:30:50,390 --> 01:30:51,983
...talking-to.

995
01:30:52,426 --> 01:30:53,256
lf...

996
01:30:53,461 --> 01:30:56,225
...you don't mind my saying so.

997
01:30:57,031 --> 01:30:58,659
Perhaps...

998
01:30:59,201 --> 01:31:00,896
...a bit more.

999
01:31:04,106 --> 01:31:05,334
My girls, sir...

1000
01:31:05,540 --> 01:31:09,341
...they didn't care for
the Overlook at first.

1001
01:31:10,014 --> 01:31:13,917
One of them actually stole
a pack of matches...

1002
01:31:14,119 --> 01:31:16,781
...and tried to burn it down.

1003
01:31:17,856 --> 01:31:19,517
But I...

1004
01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:21,691
...corrected them, sir.

1005
01:31:23,028 --> 01:31:27,158
And when my wife tried to prevent me
from doing my duty...

1006
01:31:27,366 --> 01:31:28,628
...I...

1007
01:31:29,636 --> 01:31:31,729
...corrected her.

1008
01:31:45,988 --> 01:31:47,922
We have the Snowcat.

1009
01:31:51,328 --> 01:31:53,092
If the weather breaks...

1010
01:31:53,297 --> 01:31:55,060
...we might just be able...

1011
01:31:55,266 --> 01:31:57,131
...to get down the mountain.

1012
01:32:00,004 --> 01:32:02,974
I could call
the forest rangers first...

1013
01:32:03,175 --> 01:32:04,472
...and...

1014
01:32:04,810 --> 01:32:06,675
...tell them that we're coming...

1015
01:32:07,046 --> 01:32:08,206
...so that...

1016
01:32:08,414 --> 01:32:12,511
...they could start searching
for us in case we didn't make it.

1017
01:32:16,291 --> 01:32:18,452
And if Jack won't come with us...

1018
01:32:20,929 --> 01:32:24,661
...I'll just have to tell him that
we're going by ourselves.

1019
01:32:24,867 --> 01:32:26,835
That's all there is to it.

1020
01:32:28,205 --> 01:32:29,695
Redrum.

1021
01:32:30,674 --> 01:32:32,336
Redrum.

1022
01:32:43,589 --> 01:32:44,749
What's the matter, hon?

1023
01:32:44,957 --> 01:32:45,855
Redrum!

1024
01:32:46,058 --> 01:32:48,118
Are you having a bad dream?

1025
01:32:54,068 --> 01:32:55,297
Hon?

1026
01:33:01,109 --> 01:33:05,012
Danny's not here, Mrs. Torrance.

1027
01:33:10,019 --> 01:33:11,544
Come on, hon.

1028
01:33:12,523 --> 01:33:13,956
Wake up.

1029
01:33:14,892 --> 01:33:17,156
You just had a bad dream.

1030
01:33:18,562 --> 01:33:20,690
Everything's okay.

1031
01:33:24,769 --> 01:33:28,638
Danny can't wake up, Mrs. Torrance.

1032
01:33:38,119 --> 01:33:39,916
Wake up!

1033
01:33:41,089 --> 01:33:42,421
Come on.

1034
01:33:42,624 --> 01:33:44,148
Right now.

1035
01:33:44,626 --> 01:33:45,991
Wake up!

1036
01:33:50,034 --> 01:33:54,061
Danny's gone away, Mrs. Torrance.

1037
01:34:04,182 --> 01:34:07,050
This is KDK 1 calling
KDK 12.

1038
01:34:07,253 --> 01:34:10,188
KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

1039
01:34:10,491 --> 01:34:12,254
Are you receiving me?

1040
01:34:15,463 --> 01:34:18,921
This is KDK 1 calling
KDK 12.

1041
01:34:19,267 --> 01:34:22,066
KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

1042
01:34:22,271 --> 01:34:23,932
Do you read me?

1043
01:34:28,310 --> 01:34:31,337
This is KDK 1 calling
KDK 12.

1044
01:34:31,549 --> 01:34:34,109
KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

1045
01:34:34,318 --> 01:34:36,081
Are you receiving me?

1046
01:35:12,529 --> 01:35:14,394
Good evening. Forest service.

1047
01:35:14,598 --> 01:35:16,829
This is Dick Hallorann again.

1048
01:35:17,035 --> 01:35:20,129
I called a while ago about
the folks at the Overlook Hotel.

1049
01:35:21,372 --> 01:35:25,173
We tried to contact them several
times but they didn't answer.

1050
01:35:25,377 --> 01:35:28,972
Maybe they got their radio
turned off or they can't hear it.

1051
01:35:29,181 --> 01:35:32,083
If you'd like, I'd be glad
to try again later on.

1052
01:35:32,587 --> 01:35:34,714
That's very nice of you.

1053
01:35:34,922 --> 01:35:36,685
I'll call you back later.

1054
01:35:36,891 --> 01:35:37,915
Bye.

1055
01:36:25,014 --> 01:36:28,041
Pardon me, miss.
What time will we get to Denver?

1056
01:36:28,251 --> 01:36:30,412
We're due to arrive at 8:20, sir.

1057
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:32,212
Thank you very much.

1058
01:37:36,131 --> 01:37:37,063
Durkin's Garage.

1059
01:37:37,265 --> 01:37:38,391
Can I speak to Larry?

1060
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:39,567
Speaking.

1061
01:37:39,868 --> 01:37:42,359
Hi, Larry. This is Dick.
Dick Hallorann.

1062
01:37:42,637 --> 01:37:44,299
Dick! How you doing?

1063
01:37:44,507 --> 01:37:45,872
How's the weather down there?

1064
01:37:46,075 --> 01:37:49,238
I'm not in Florida.
I'm calling from Stapleton Airport.

1065
01:37:49,612 --> 01:37:51,204
What are you doing there?

1066
01:37:51,648 --> 01:37:55,084
I just got in from Miami.
I got to get to the Overlook today.

1067
01:37:55,286 --> 01:37:56,913
What's the weather like there?

1068
01:37:57,555 --> 01:38:00,423
The snowplows are keeping things
moving in town...

1069
01:38:00,626 --> 01:38:02,560
...but the mountain roads
are blocked.

1070
01:38:03,095 --> 01:38:05,791
Then I'm going to need a Snowcat
to get up there.

1071
01:38:05,998 --> 01:38:07,830
Can you fix me up with one?

1072
01:38:08,034 --> 01:38:10,127
What's the big deal
about getting there today...

1073
01:38:10,337 --> 01:38:11,895
...especially in this weather?

1074
01:38:12,773 --> 01:38:16,232
Larry, just between you and me,
we got a very serious problem...

1075
01:38:16,445 --> 01:38:18,675
...with the people taking care
of the place.

1076
01:38:18,881 --> 01:38:22,750
They turned out to be
completely unreliable assholes.

1077
01:38:22,952 --> 01:38:24,749
Ullman phoned me last night.

1078
01:38:24,954 --> 01:38:28,321
And I'm supposed to find out
if they have to be replaced.

1079
01:38:29,793 --> 01:38:31,819
How long will it take you
to get here?

1080
01:38:32,163 --> 01:38:33,824
About five hours.

1081
01:38:34,031 --> 01:38:36,261
I'm going to rent a car
here at the airport.

1082
01:38:36,767 --> 01:38:38,497
Okay, I'll take care of it.

1083
01:38:38,703 --> 01:38:41,536
Thanks, Larry.
I really appreciate that.

1084
01:38:41,740 --> 01:38:44,300
That's all right. Drive carefully.

1085
01:38:50,049 --> 01:38:53,314
You're with Hal and Charlie
on Radio 63, KHOW, Denver.

1086
01:38:53,519 --> 01:38:56,080
And we have a bad day out there.

1087
01:38:56,290 --> 01:38:59,657
Heavy snow throughout
the Denver metro area.

1088
01:38:59,861 --> 01:39:01,351
Many mountain passes...

1089
01:39:01,563 --> 01:39:04,431
...Wolf Creek and Red Mountain
passes are closed...

1090
01:39:04,633 --> 01:39:07,932
...and the chain law is in effect
at the Eisenhower Tunnel.

1091
01:39:08,137 --> 01:39:09,799
We hear from the news department...

1092
01:39:10,006 --> 01:39:13,203
...only a few flights are
landing at Stapleton Airport...

1093
01:39:13,410 --> 01:39:15,002
...and with storms like this...

1094
01:39:15,212 --> 01:39:19,343
...I guess the entire airport will
be closed within the hour.

1095
01:39:19,518 --> 01:39:22,385
The storm will continue through
the day and the Weather Service...

1096
01:39:22,588 --> 01:39:25,057
...has declared a stockman's
and traveler's advisory...

1097
01:39:25,258 --> 01:39:28,056
...for all areas outlying
the Denver metro region.

1098
01:39:28,261 --> 01:39:29,626
Get the cows in the barn.

1099
01:39:51,121 --> 01:39:52,179
Hon?

1100
01:39:57,161 --> 01:39:59,595
Listen to me
for a minute, will you?

1101
01:40:03,402 --> 01:40:07,100
I'm just going to go and
talk to Daddy for a few minutes...

1102
01:40:07,307 --> 01:40:09,332
...and I'll be right back.

1103
01:40:10,310 --> 01:40:12,836
I want you to just stay here...

1104
01:40:13,047 --> 01:40:15,538
...and watch your cartoons, okay?

1105
01:40:18,654 --> 01:40:20,122
Okay, hon?

1106
01:40:23,426 --> 01:40:26,292
Yes, Mrs. Torrance.

1107
01:40:35,071 --> 01:40:36,266
All right.

1108
01:40:38,342 --> 01:40:41,243
I'll be back
in just about five minutes.

1109
01:40:42,047 --> 01:40:44,380
I'm going to lock the door
behind me.

1110
01:44:10,757 --> 01:44:12,452
How do you like it?

1111
01:44:19,066 --> 01:44:20,590
How do you like it?

1112
01:44:30,547 --> 01:44:33,209
What are you doing down here?

1113
01:44:37,589 --> 01:44:39,921
I just...

1114
01:44:40,391 --> 01:44:41,415
...wanted...

1115
01:44:41,860 --> 01:44:43,589
...to talk to you.

1116
01:44:45,966 --> 01:44:47,228
Okay.

1117
01:44:47,834 --> 01:44:49,301
Let's talk.

1118
01:44:59,113 --> 01:45:01,105
What do you want to talk about?

1119
01:45:09,026 --> 01:45:12,189
I can't really remember.

1120
01:45:12,997 --> 01:45:15,124
You can't remember.

1121
01:45:15,934 --> 01:45:17,265
No...

1122
01:45:17,636 --> 01:45:19,035
...I can't.

1123
01:45:24,343 --> 01:45:27,608
Maybe it was about Danny?

1124
01:45:29,983 --> 01:45:32,680
Maybe it was about him.

1125
01:45:36,324 --> 01:45:39,624
I think we should discuss Danny.

1126
01:45:42,431 --> 01:45:44,228
I think...

1127
01:45:44,633 --> 01:45:48,400
...we should discuss
what should be done with him.

1128
01:45:53,109 --> 01:45:55,704
What should be done with him?

1129
01:46:00,685 --> 01:46:02,482
I don't know.

1130
01:46:02,988 --> 01:46:04,979
I don't think that's true.

1131
01:46:05,190 --> 01:46:07,784
I think you have some
very definite ideas...

1132
01:46:07,994 --> 01:46:09,689
...about what should be done
with Danny.

1133
01:46:09,896 --> 01:46:12,491
And I'd like to know
what they are.

1134
01:46:14,401 --> 01:46:16,198
Well, I...

1135
01:46:16,503 --> 01:46:20,907
...I think maybe he should be taken
to a doctor.

1136
01:46:21,109 --> 01:46:24,408
You think "maybe"
he should be taken to a doctor?

1137
01:46:26,649 --> 01:46:29,982
When do you think "maybe"
he should be taken to a doctor?

1138
01:46:30,620 --> 01:46:31,985
As soon as possible?

1139
01:46:32,589 --> 01:46:34,922
"As soon as possible?"

1140
01:46:37,595 --> 01:46:39,028
Please.

1141
01:46:40,431 --> 01:46:43,697
You believe his health
might be at stake.

1142
01:46:45,270 --> 01:46:46,794
Yes.

1143
01:46:48,141 --> 01:46:50,770
And you are concerned about him.

1144
01:46:53,347 --> 01:46:55,577
And are you concerned about me?

1145
01:46:56,417 --> 01:46:57,578
Of course I am.

1146
01:46:57,786 --> 01:47:00,016
Of course you are!

1147
01:47:00,222 --> 01:47:03,350
Have you ever thought about
my responsibilities?

1148
01:47:03,558 --> 01:47:05,049
What are you talking about?

1149
01:47:05,261 --> 01:47:08,094
Have you ever had
a single moment's...

1150
01:47:08,298 --> 01:47:10,357
...thought about
my responsibilities?

1151
01:47:10,567 --> 01:47:12,832
Have you ever thought
for a single moment...

1152
01:47:13,038 --> 01:47:15,836
...about my responsibilities
to my employers?!

1153
01:47:16,107 --> 01:47:17,938
Has is ever occurred to you...

1154
01:47:18,143 --> 01:47:21,636
...that I have agreed to look after
the hotel until May 1st?

1155
01:47:21,881 --> 01:47:23,906
Does it matter to you at all...

1156
01:47:24,116 --> 01:47:27,210
...that the owners have placed
their complete confidence in me...

1157
01:47:27,420 --> 01:47:30,549
...and that I have signed
a letter of agreement...

1158
01:47:30,758 --> 01:47:33,352
...in which I've accepted
that responsibility?

1159
01:47:33,828 --> 01:47:35,853
Do you have the slightest idea...

1160
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:39,296
...what a moral and ethical
principal is? Do you?!

1161
01:47:39,668 --> 01:47:42,761
Has it ever occurred to you what
would happen to my future...

1162
01:47:42,970 --> 01:47:45,371
...if I fail to live up to
my responsibilities?

1163
01:47:45,574 --> 01:47:47,872
Has it ever occurred to you?
Has it?!

1164
01:47:48,077 --> 01:47:49,601
Stay away from me!

1165
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:51,538
Why?

1166
01:47:51,849 --> 01:47:54,818
I just want to go back to my room.

1167
01:47:55,019 --> 01:47:56,281
Why?

1168
01:47:56,921 --> 01:47:57,785
Well...

1169
01:47:58,923 --> 01:48:00,949
...I'm very confused.

1170
01:48:02,094 --> 01:48:05,757
And I just need a chance
to think things over.

1171
01:48:06,798 --> 01:48:10,735
You've had your whole fucking life
to think things over!

1172
01:48:10,938 --> 01:48:13,702
What good's a few minutes more
going to do you now?

1173
01:48:14,675 --> 01:48:16,166
Stay away from me!

1174
01:48:16,511 --> 01:48:17,808
Please!

1175
01:48:18,580 --> 01:48:19,638
Don't hurt me.

1176
01:48:19,848 --> 01:48:21,179
I'm not going to hurt you.

1177
01:48:21,382 --> 01:48:22,576
Stay away from me!

1178
01:48:22,784 --> 01:48:23,649
Stay away!

1179
01:48:23,853 --> 01:48:24,842
Darling.

1180
01:48:25,054 --> 01:48:26,612
Light of my life.

1181
01:48:27,056 --> 01:48:28,387
I'm not going to hurt you.

1182
01:48:28,591 --> 01:48:30,582
You didn't let me finish
my sentence.

1183
01:48:30,795 --> 01:48:32,990
I said,
"I'm not going to hurt you."

1184
01:48:33,197 --> 01:48:35,961
I'm just going to bash
your brains in.

1185
01:48:36,234 --> 01:48:39,204
I'm going to bash them
right the fuck in.

1186
01:48:40,272 --> 01:48:41,830
Stay away from me!

1187
01:48:42,341 --> 01:48:43,365
Stay away from me!

1188
01:48:43,575 --> 01:48:45,975
I'm not going to hurt you.

1189
01:48:46,245 --> 01:48:47,770
Stay away from me!

1190
01:48:48,014 --> 01:48:49,072
Stay away!

1191
01:48:49,949 --> 01:48:51,177
Please!

1192
01:48:52,219 --> 01:48:53,982
Stop swinging the bat.

1193
01:48:54,189 --> 01:48:55,451
Stay away from me.

1194
01:48:56,224 --> 01:48:57,521
Put that bat down, Wendy.

1195
01:48:57,726 --> 01:48:59,216
Stop it!

1196
01:49:00,695 --> 01:49:01,821
Give me the bat.

1197
01:49:02,031 --> 01:49:03,157
Please!

1198
01:49:03,399 --> 01:49:05,594
- Stay away!
- Give me the bat.

1199
01:49:05,801 --> 01:49:06,859
Stop it!

1200
01:49:07,103 --> 01:49:08,536
Give me the bat.

1201
01:49:08,871 --> 01:49:10,499
- Stay away from me.
- Stop swinging the bat.

1202
01:49:10,707 --> 01:49:12,072
Please stop!

1203
01:49:12,277 --> 01:49:13,471
Give me the bat.

1204
01:49:13,678 --> 01:49:14,906
Stay away from me.

1205
01:49:15,180 --> 01:49:17,547
- Stop it!
- Give me the bat.

1206
01:49:18,951 --> 01:49:19,975
Goddamn-!

1207
01:50:35,273 --> 01:50:36,969
What are you doing?

1208
01:50:39,778 --> 01:50:41,245
Wait a minute.

1209
01:50:42,648 --> 01:50:44,640
What are you doing?

1210
01:50:47,487 --> 01:50:48,715
What are you doing?

1211
01:51:02,605 --> 01:51:04,095
Wait a minute!

1212
01:51:06,475 --> 01:51:08,068
What are you doing?

1213
01:51:08,312 --> 01:51:10,041
Open the door!

1214
01:51:11,348 --> 01:51:12,372
Goddamn it!

1215
01:51:12,582 --> 01:51:16,144
Let me out of here!
Open the goddamn door!

1216
01:51:19,857 --> 01:51:21,085
Wendy, listen.

1217
01:51:21,526 --> 01:51:24,462
Let me out and I'll forget
the whole goddamn thing.

1218
01:51:24,663 --> 01:51:27,131
It'll be just like
nothing ever happened.

1219
01:51:41,817 --> 01:51:43,182
Baby.

1220
01:51:44,386 --> 01:51:47,686
I think you hurt my head
real bad.

1221
01:51:49,292 --> 01:51:50,953
I'm dizzy.

1222
01:51:51,961 --> 01:51:54,157
I need a doctor.

1223
01:52:01,039 --> 01:52:02,234
Honey.

1224
01:52:04,910 --> 01:52:07,242
Don't leave me in here.

1225
01:52:15,857 --> 01:52:17,758
I'm going to go now.

1226
01:52:20,829 --> 01:52:22,660
I'm going to try...

1227
01:52:22,865 --> 01:52:25,858
...to get Danny down
the Sidewinder...

1228
01:52:26,569 --> 01:52:28,935
...in the Snowcat today.

1229
01:52:31,174 --> 01:52:33,006
I'll bring back a doctor.

1230
01:52:38,383 --> 01:52:40,249
I'm going to go now.

1231
01:52:47,693 --> 01:52:51,494
You've got a big surprise
coming to you.

1232
01:52:52,966 --> 01:52:55,560
You're not going anywhere.

1233
01:52:57,239 --> 01:53:01,369
Go check out the Snowcat and the
radio, and you'll see what I mean.

1234
01:53:05,982 --> 01:53:07,677
Go check it out.

1235
01:53:09,819 --> 01:53:12,015
Go check it out!

1236
01:53:15,392 --> 01:53:17,326
Go check it out.

1237
01:55:05,187 --> 01:55:07,587
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.

1238
01:55:08,325 --> 01:55:10,293
Delbert Grady.

1239
01:55:11,861 --> 01:55:13,453
Grady?

1240
01:55:33,821 --> 01:55:35,652
Hello, Grady.

1241
01:55:40,329 --> 01:55:42,126
Mr. Torrance...

1242
01:55:44,066 --> 01:55:47,798
...I see you can hardly
have taken care of the...

1243
01:55:48,538 --> 01:55:51,029
...business we discussed.

1244
01:55:57,749 --> 01:56:00,684
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady.

1245
01:56:01,553 --> 01:56:05,615
I'll deal with that situation
as soon as I get out of here.

1246
01:56:06,493 --> 01:56:09,223
Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance?

1247
01:56:09,729 --> 01:56:11,561
I wonder.

1248
01:56:12,733 --> 01:56:14,826
I have my doubts.

1249
01:56:16,037 --> 01:56:20,270
I, and others, have come
to believe...

1250
01:56:20,475 --> 01:56:23,467
...that your heart is not in this.

1251
01:56:24,113 --> 01:56:26,639
That you haven't the belly for it.

1252
01:56:32,823 --> 01:56:37,124
Just give me one more chance
to prove it, Mr. Grady.

1253
01:56:37,962 --> 01:56:39,896
That's all I ask.

1254
01:56:41,434 --> 01:56:45,701
Your wife appears to be stronger
than we imagined, Mr. Torrance.

1255
01:56:45,906 --> 01:56:47,372
Somewhat more...

1256
01:56:47,573 --> 01:56:49,541
...resourceful.

1257
01:56:49,810 --> 01:56:52,574
She seems to have got
the better of you.

1258
01:56:55,816 --> 01:56:58,479
For the moment, Mr. Grady.

1259
01:56:59,220 --> 01:57:01,381
Only for the moment.

1260
01:57:03,292 --> 01:57:07,457
I fear you will have to deal
with this matter...

1261
01:57:07,731 --> 01:57:11,394
...in the harshest possible way,
Mr. Torrance.

1262
01:57:11,968 --> 01:57:13,527
I fear...

1263
01:57:13,804 --> 01:57:16,364
...that is the only thing to do.

1264
01:57:19,844 --> 01:57:21,938
There's nothing
I look forward to...

1265
01:57:22,147 --> 01:57:26,049
...with greater pleasure,
Mr. Grady.

1266
01:57:27,453 --> 01:57:30,184
You give your word on that,
do you, Mr. Torrance?

1267
01:57:31,658 --> 01:57:33,683
I give you my word.

1268
01:58:45,811 --> 01:58:48,372
Redrum.

1269
01:58:49,316 --> 01:58:51,876
Redrum.

1270
02:00:59,868 --> 02:01:01,426
Danny, stop it!

1271
02:01:58,236 --> 02:01:59,703
I'm home.

1272
02:02:37,048 --> 02:02:39,915
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

1273
02:03:05,481 --> 02:03:07,346
I can't get out.

1274
02:03:08,151 --> 02:03:09,277
Run!

1275
02:03:10,119 --> 02:03:11,552
Run and hide!

1276
02:03:12,090 --> 02:03:13,216
Run!

1277
02:03:13,424 --> 02:03:14,652
Quick!

1278
02:03:16,361 --> 02:03:20,890
Little pigs, little pigs,
let me come in.

1279
02:03:26,639 --> 02:03:30,041
Not by the hair
on your chinny-chin-chin?

1280
02:03:31,579 --> 02:03:33,638
Then I'll huff...

1281
02:03:33,848 --> 02:03:35,749
...and I'll puff...

1282
02:03:35,951 --> 02:03:38,010
...and I'll blow your house in!

1283
02:03:52,938 --> 02:03:54,303
Please!

1284
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:56,803
Don't!

1285
02:03:57,475 --> 02:03:59,000
Don't!

1286
02:04:17,599 --> 02:04:18,827
Stop it!

1287
02:04:23,072 --> 02:04:24,630
