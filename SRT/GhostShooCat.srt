1
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,335
Oh, this is great.

2
00:02:50,611 --> 00:02:51,600
That's incredible.

3
00:02:51,745 --> 00:02:55,237
There's got to be
7 or 8 feet up there.

4
00:02:55,315 --> 00:02:57,249
And 80 years of dust.

5
00:02:57,317 --> 00:02:59,148
Look at all this height.

6
00:02:59,252 --> 00:03:00,446
With our bedroom upstairs,

7
00:03:00,554 --> 00:03:01,816
we'd have all this space.

8
00:03:02,089 --> 00:03:03,181
For what?

9
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,814
Just space.

10
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,751
1...

11
00:03:07,895 --> 00:03:09,487
2...

12
00:03:09,631 --> 00:03:10,689
3!

13
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:13,422
And 4?

14
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,397
And 5?

15
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:21,331
Watch it. Watch it.

16
00:03:21,476 --> 00:03:23,774
God, this place
is huge.

17
00:03:26,614 --> 00:03:27,911
It's beautiful.

18
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:29,582
God!

19
00:03:29,684 --> 00:03:32,175
You guys, it's
absolutely incredible.

20
00:03:32,286 --> 00:03:33,776
Incredible.

21
00:03:33,888 --> 00:03:36,789
A little paint,
you could sell this tomorrow

22
00:03:36,891 --> 00:03:38,358
and double your money.

23
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,620
Carl, you're obsessed.

24
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,492
A little bit.

25
00:03:42,631 --> 00:03:43,757
Whoa, look!

26
00:03:46,535 --> 00:03:48,469
Hey, it's
an Indian head penny.

27
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,231
1898.

28
00:03:52,808 --> 00:03:54,298
It's a good omen.

29
00:03:55,844 --> 00:03:57,334
You're the good omen.

30
00:04:01,517 --> 00:04:03,451
Oh, it's so great.

31
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,863
I had Rose
move your 3:00 to 4:00.

32
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,865
Gary Allen called
late yesterday.

33
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:19,434
He has to see you

34
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:21,867
about the final painting bids
for the loft.

35
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:24,439
3:00 is the only time
he can make it.

36
00:04:25,842 --> 00:04:27,173
Sam?

37
00:04:30,413 --> 00:04:31,710
Huh? Oh, I'm sorry.

38
00:04:31,815 --> 00:04:34,716
Relax. This isn't brain surgery
you're going into.

39
00:04:34,818 --> 00:04:37,719
Pitching these Japanese guys
makes me so nervous.

40
00:04:37,821 --> 00:04:39,550
Sam...

41
00:04:39,656 --> 00:04:41,988
you're going
to be great, OK?

42
00:04:42,258 --> 00:04:44,556
What am I supposed to say?

43
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:45,821
I can't tell them

44
00:04:45,929 --> 00:04:48,397
my Swedish pompom girl joke,
you know.

45
00:04:48,698 --> 00:04:51,030
Those are great.
Where'd you get those?

46
00:04:51,301 --> 00:04:52,598
Nice, huh? Molly.

47
00:04:52,702 --> 00:04:55,035
What do you think?
Are they me?

48
00:04:55,306 --> 00:04:57,035
Man, look at that.
A Testarossa.

49
00:04:58,309 --> 00:04:59,037
Ouch.

50
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,675
Pay off
your Mustang first.

51
00:05:11,255 --> 00:05:12,586
How are you feeling?

52
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,180
What did the doctor say?

53
00:05:14,258 --> 00:05:16,192
He said it was contagious,

54
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,591
that it was really...

55
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,719
No.

56
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:22,321
He said I shouldn't
be coming in today.

57
00:05:22,466 --> 00:05:23,831
What about the rash?

58
00:05:25,302 --> 00:05:26,326
The rash?

59
00:05:27,605 --> 00:05:28,937
The rash is...

60
00:05:29,007 --> 00:05:30,474
also incredibly
contagious.

61
00:05:30,609 --> 00:05:32,509
He said they've
both been spreading.

62
00:05:32,611 --> 00:05:33,771
No.

63
00:05:37,082 --> 00:05:39,243
On your genitals
again?

64
00:05:39,384 --> 00:05:40,373
Yeah.

65
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:42,453
Yeah, right on
the genitals.

66
00:05:42,521 --> 00:05:43,920
Basically everywhere.

67
00:05:44,055 --> 00:05:46,546
He said that I
shouldn't touch anyone.

68
00:05:47,826 --> 00:05:49,316
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:53,465 --> 00:05:54,363
You're sick.

70
00:05:54,499 --> 00:05:55,363
I know.

71
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,364
Morning, Paul.

72
00:05:56,501 --> 00:05:57,832
Morning,
Carl, Sam.

73
00:05:57,903 --> 00:05:58,927
Hey, Paul.

74
00:05:59,037 --> 00:06:00,402
Morning, Mr. Wheat.

75
00:06:00,505 --> 00:06:01,767
Morning, Susan.
You're looking good.

76
00:06:01,873 --> 00:06:02,862
Sam?

77
00:06:03,008 --> 00:06:04,567
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

78
00:06:06,512 --> 00:06:07,843
Here it is.

79
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:08,969
Thanks.

80
00:06:11,484 --> 00:06:12,473
Morning, Sam.

81
00:06:12,618 --> 00:06:14,518
Morning. Listen,
the Kobiashi people…

82
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,417
They're already here.

83
00:06:16,522 --> 00:06:17,716
They're early.

84
00:06:17,824 --> 00:06:18,848
I know.

85
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,859
Come here. How long
have they been here?

86
00:06:21,961 --> 00:06:23,451
About 10 minutes.

87
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:24,860
Andy Dillon called

88
00:06:24,964 --> 00:06:28,456
and says he needs $900,000
transferred to Albany by 10:00.

89
00:06:28,568 --> 00:06:29,592
By 10:00?

90
00:06:29,702 --> 00:06:30,760
Yes.

91
00:06:32,872 --> 00:06:33,896
Carl?

92
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,371
Yeah?

93
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,602
Dillon needs 900,000
in Albany by 10:00.

94
00:06:40,714 --> 00:06:43,649
Can you transfer it
to his payroll account?

95
00:06:43,717 --> 00:06:45,651
I'll need your Mac code.

96
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:46,743
OK.

97
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,649
Discretion, right?

98
00:06:53,727 --> 00:06:54,785
Got it.

99
00:06:54,895 --> 00:06:57,659
You bet.
I'll do it right now.

100
00:06:57,731 --> 00:06:59,693
Bill, I'll call you back.

101
00:07:10,344 --> 00:07:12,073
OK, OK, that's fine.
That's fine.

102
00:07:12,346 --> 00:07:13,438
That's fine!

103
00:07:15,082 --> 00:07:17,017
Aw, man,
it's too far out.

104
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,620
Can you
get this, man?

105
00:07:20,722 --> 00:07:22,622
Where
are you guys from,

106
00:07:22,724 --> 00:07:24,624
the New York City Ballet?

107
00:07:29,063 --> 00:07:30,360
Almost.

108
00:07:34,903 --> 00:07:36,370
Saved your life!

109
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:37,403
You shit.

110
00:07:37,538 --> 00:07:38,732
You scared me to death.

111
00:07:38,873 --> 00:07:40,340
Why'd you do that?

112
00:07:40,441 --> 00:07:42,773
It's better than seeing
this gorgeous body

113
00:07:42,877 --> 00:07:44,344
splattered
all over the place.

114
00:07:44,445 --> 00:07:45,639
Look out.

115
00:07:51,987 --> 00:07:54,421
Sam? Molly?
You guys home?

116
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,821
Did you invite Carl?

117
00:07:55,925 --> 00:07:56,823
Slave labor.

118
00:07:56,926 --> 00:07:57,824
- Carl?
- What?

119
00:07:57,927 --> 00:07:58,825
Hurry. Help.

120
00:07:58,928 --> 00:08:00,122
Oh, my God.

121
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:01,920
Grab the bottom.

122
00:08:02,031 --> 00:08:03,521
Want this down here?

123
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,362
Right here?

124
00:08:05,467 --> 00:08:06,798
Watch your toes.

125
00:08:06,902 --> 00:08:08,893
Where do you want this?

126
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:10,972
Uh, in the bedroom.

127
00:08:13,542 --> 00:08:15,442
God, this place
looks great.

128
00:08:15,544 --> 00:08:16,533
Yeah.

129
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:18,010
You like it, huh?

130
00:08:18,113 --> 00:08:20,013
Like is hardly
the word.

131
00:08:20,115 --> 00:08:22,583
I didn't know it would be
this beautiful.

132
00:08:22,718 --> 00:08:24,049
Molly, what about her?

133
00:08:24,153 --> 00:08:27,054
Leave her there
until we get the rest in.

134
00:08:27,157 --> 00:08:28,624
What are these?

135
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:30,625
Oh, let me show you.

136
00:08:30,727 --> 00:08:32,627
Help me
lift this up.

137
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:33,627
Here?

138
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:34,628
Voila!

139
00:08:35,732 --> 00:08:37,063
What do you think?

140
00:08:37,167 --> 00:08:39,067
It's fantastic.
I love it.

141
00:08:40,503 --> 00:08:42,801
Sam, what's
this chair doing here?

142
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,407
What do you mean?
I love that chair.

143
00:08:45,542 --> 00:08:47,635
I know, but we discussed this...

144
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,108
I've had it forever.

145
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:52,113
When I watch TV,
I sit in it.

146
00:08:52,215 --> 00:08:53,682
This chair is ugly.

147
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:54,681
So?

148
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,718
And it doesn't go
with anything.

149
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,151
It goes with me.

150
00:08:58,221 --> 00:08:59,654
You're right.
It does.

151
00:09:01,491 --> 00:09:02,788
We'll paint it.

152
00:09:02,893 --> 00:09:04,190
We'll what?

153
00:09:13,704 --> 00:09:14,762
Are you OK?

154
00:09:16,006 --> 00:09:17,237
I'm fine.

155
00:09:20,911 --> 00:09:23,038
What's the matter?

156
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:24,580
Nothing.

157
00:09:28,586 --> 00:09:30,554
You worried
about the promotion?

158
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,517
No, not really.

159
00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:45,193
Then what?

160
00:09:45,303 --> 00:09:47,168
Is it moving in
together?

161
00:09:47,239 --> 00:09:48,900
No.

162
00:09:53,045 --> 00:09:54,637
I don't know.
It's...

163
00:09:54,746 --> 00:09:56,543
a lot of things.

164
00:10:00,652 --> 00:10:03,587
I just don't want
the bubble to burst.

165
00:10:05,857 --> 00:10:07,256
Seems like...

166
00:10:09,594 --> 00:10:12,324
whenever anything good
in my life happens,

167
00:10:12,597 --> 00:10:15,658
I'm just afraid
I'm going to lose it.

168
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:22,599
I love you.

169
00:10:22,742 --> 00:10:24,642
I really love you.

170
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,307
Ditto.

171
00:10:32,418 --> 00:10:33,817
The pilot
first reported trouble

172
00:10:33,953 --> 00:10:35,818
when the number two
engine blew,

173
00:10:35,955 --> 00:10:39,288
the one in the tail
of the plane...

174
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:41,724
Oh, Jesus,
another one?

175
00:10:43,696 --> 00:10:45,220
Oh, don't watch that.

176
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,591
I should cancel
my L.A. Trip.

177
00:10:49,702 --> 00:10:52,729
These things always
happen in threes.

178
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,831
Sam, get serious.

179
00:10:54,975 --> 00:10:57,273
Besides, you lead
a charmed life.

180
00:10:57,411 --> 00:10:59,345
Oh, yeah?
So did they.

181
00:11:01,014 --> 00:11:02,140
It's amazing.

182
00:11:02,249 --> 00:11:03,807
Just like that.

183
00:11:03,917 --> 00:11:05,111
Blackout.

184
00:12:02,344 --> 00:12:06,974
"My love"

185
00:12:07,116 --> 00:12:10,381
"My darlin"

186
00:12:10,452 --> 00:12:12,886
"I've hungered for..."

187
00:12:12,988 --> 00:12:14,353
What are you doing?

188
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,383
I couldn't sleep.

189
00:12:17,493 --> 00:12:20,394
"A long"

190
00:12:20,496 --> 00:12:22,691
"Lonely time"

191
00:12:22,831 --> 00:12:24,731
I must
have passed out.

192
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,960
What time is it?

193
00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:28,400
It's 2 a. M.

194
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,065
"And time"

195
00:12:32,174 --> 00:12:35,940
"Goes by"

196
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:39,344
"So slowly"

197
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:42,316
"And time"

198
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:46,321
"Can do so much"

199
00:12:46,423 --> 00:12:50,325
"Are you"

200
00:12:50,427 --> 00:12:52,725
"Still mine"

201
00:12:52,862 --> 00:12:54,830
Oh, no.

202
00:12:54,998 --> 00:12:56,932
I hope it wasn't
a masterpiece.

203
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,728
It's not now.

204
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,903
Can I help?

205
00:13:01,972 --> 00:13:03,030
Yeah.

206
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:06,040
Put your hands here
and get them wet.

207
00:13:08,011 --> 00:13:12,311
Just let the clay
slide between your fingers.

208
00:13:12,382 --> 00:13:16,114
"Godspeed your love"

209
00:13:16,187 --> 00:13:21,454
"To me"

210
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:30,100
"Lonely rivers flow"

211
00:13:30,201 --> 00:13:32,066
"To the sea"

212
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:34,296
"To the sea"

213
00:13:34,372 --> 00:13:37,364
"To the open arms"

214
00:13:37,475 --> 00:13:39,773
"Of the sea"

215
00:13:39,877 --> 00:13:41,538
"Yeah"

216
00:13:41,846 --> 00:13:44,838
"Lonely rivers sigh"

217
00:13:44,982 --> 00:13:46,449
"Wait for me"

218
00:13:46,584 --> 00:13:48,951
"Wait for me"

219
00:13:49,054 --> 00:13:52,023
"I'll be comin' home"

220
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:56,220
"Wait for me"

221
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:03,333
"My love"

222
00:14:03,435 --> 00:14:07,030
"My darlin'"

223
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,130
"I've hungered"

224
00:14:09,241 --> 00:14:14,372
"Hungered for your touch"

225
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:17,448
"A long"

226
00:14:17,549 --> 00:14:21,349
"Lonely time"

227
00:14:25,325 --> 00:14:28,988
"And time"

228
00:14:29,095 --> 00:14:32,462
"Goes by"

229
00:14:32,598 --> 00:14:36,364
"So slowly"

230
00:14:36,436 --> 00:14:38,404
"And time"

231
00:14:38,471 --> 00:14:43,033
"Can do so much"

232
00:14:43,109 --> 00:14:46,909
"Are you"

233
00:14:47,013 --> 00:14:53,145
"Still mine"

234
00:14:54,287 --> 00:14:58,155
"I need"

235
00:14:58,257 --> 00:15:01,523
"Your love"

236
00:15:01,628 --> 00:15:04,893
"I"

237
00:15:05,032 --> 00:15:08,798
"I need your love"

238
00:15:08,902 --> 00:15:12,565
"Godspeed your love"

239
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:19,143
"To me"

240
00:16:05,193 --> 00:16:06,558
Oh, no.

241
00:16:08,196 --> 00:16:09,527
What's the matter?

242
00:16:11,232 --> 00:16:12,564
A glitch.
What's up?

243
00:16:12,668 --> 00:16:15,569
The Greenberg and White accounts-
I can't get in.

244
00:16:15,671 --> 00:16:17,002
The Mac code
isn't working.

245
00:16:17,106 --> 00:16:18,300
Oh, I changed it.

246
00:16:18,374 --> 00:16:19,306
Why?

247
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,037
Nothing. I want to
nose around a bit.

248
00:16:22,144 --> 00:16:23,475
Is something wrong?

249
00:16:24,613 --> 00:16:26,342
Can you keep a secret?

250
00:16:28,384 --> 00:16:30,079
Yeah, sure.

251
00:16:30,219 --> 00:16:31,345
What's up?

252
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,955
There's too much money
in these accounts.

253
00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:36,023
Too much money?
That's impossible.

254
00:16:41,764 --> 00:16:44,528
Sam, this is going
to take you hours.

255
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:46,123
Let me do this.

256
00:16:46,235 --> 00:16:47,567
It's already
taken me hours.

257
00:16:47,637 --> 00:16:49,127
Let me figure it out.

258
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:50,570
No, that's OK.

259
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,574
It's like
a vendetta now.

260
00:16:52,642 --> 00:16:54,576
Thanks, though.
I appreciate it.

261
00:16:54,644 --> 00:16:55,668
OK.

262
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:58,714
If you start to go blind,
give a shout.

263
00:16:58,782 --> 00:17:01,250
OK. Adios.

264
00:17:01,351 --> 00:17:04,582
Listen, what are you
and Moll doing tonight?

265
00:17:04,721 --> 00:17:07,622
We're going to the theater
to see Macbeth.

266
00:17:07,724 --> 00:17:09,692
She likes
the guys in tights.

267
00:17:09,993 --> 00:17:11,324
You want to go?

268
00:17:11,428 --> 00:17:12,452
No, thanks.

269
00:17:12,562 --> 00:17:14,189
I want a full
report, though.

270
00:17:14,297 --> 00:17:15,355
Later.

271
00:17:15,432 --> 00:17:16,490
Yeah.

272
00:17:22,138 --> 00:17:23,470
Well, I loved it.

273
00:17:23,574 --> 00:17:26,065
I was spellbound
the whole time.

274
00:17:26,143 --> 00:17:27,474
I could tell.

275
00:17:27,578 --> 00:17:29,068
So could
everyone else

276
00:17:29,146 --> 00:17:31,637
with that resonating
snore of yours.

277
00:17:36,754 --> 00:17:39,222
Did I tell you
what Melissa said?

278
00:17:39,323 --> 00:17:40,654
Yeah, about six times.

279
00:17:40,758 --> 00:17:42,225
It wasn't six times.

280
00:17:42,326 --> 00:17:44,658
Quit being
so blase about this.

281
00:17:44,762 --> 00:17:46,252
This is really
important.

282
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,662
I'll have two pieces
in her gallery.

283
00:17:48,766 --> 00:17:52,702
The New York Times
reviews her gallery all the time.

284
00:17:52,803 --> 00:17:54,293
Molly,
The New York Times

285
00:17:54,372 --> 00:17:56,306
is just some
frustrated little critic

286
00:17:56,374 --> 00:17:59,640
with pimples on his ass
who flunked art school.

287
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,110
Who cares what they think?

288
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,545
About eight million
readers, that's who.

289
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:07,449
Nah, they're just
reading the sports page.

290
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,453
Your work
is really beautiful.

291
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,055
It really is.

292
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:12,180
Thanks.

293
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:14,622
It shouldn't matter
what anyone else thinks,

294
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:16,193
just what I think.

295
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,598
I want
to marry you, Sam.

296
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:25,033
What?

297
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,400
What?

298
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,064
Yep.

299
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:31,438
I've been
thinking about it.

300
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,001
I've been thinking
about it a lot,

301
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:37,241
and I think we
should just do it.

302
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,113
You're serious.

303
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:40,584
Yeah.

304
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,119
What's that look for?

305
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:54,166
You never wanted
to talk about it.

306
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:05,640
Do you love me, Sam?

307
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:08,771
Well, what do you think?

308
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:10,812
Why don't you
ever say it?

309
00:19:11,051 --> 00:19:14,384
What do you mean?
I say it all the time.

310
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:15,819
No, you say "ditto,"

311
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,149
and that's
not the same.

312
00:19:19,793 --> 00:19:22,694
People say I love you
all the time,

313
00:19:22,796 --> 00:19:25,230
and it doesn't
mean anything.

314
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:30,735
You know, sometimes
you need to hear it.

315
00:19:32,106 --> 00:19:33,869
I need to hear it.

316
00:19:35,643 --> 00:19:36,667
Let's go.

317
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:46,684
What should we do?

318
00:19:46,755 --> 00:19:48,245
Let me handle it.

319
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,687
What do you want?

320
00:19:49,824 --> 00:19:51,724
Your wallet-
give it to me!

321
00:19:51,826 --> 00:19:54,852
Sam, just give it to him.

322
00:19:56,498 --> 00:19:59,592
OK, just take the money.
Just leave-

323
00:19:59,668 --> 00:20:01,431
No, Sam-

324
00:20:01,503 --> 00:20:03,437
You son of a bitch!

325
00:20:05,674 --> 00:20:07,437
Sam, don't!

326
00:20:08,743 --> 00:20:10,233
Somebody help us!

327
00:20:10,345 --> 00:20:12,404
Jesus Christ, Sam!

328
00:20:13,615 --> 00:20:15,242
Just get off him.

329
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,942
Somebody!

330
00:20:17,218 --> 00:20:18,913
Somebody help us!

331
00:20:19,187 --> 00:20:20,779
Sam, just let...

332
00:20:21,991 --> 00:20:23,788
Sam, stop it.

333
00:20:23,926 --> 00:20:25,393
Stop it, Sam!

334
00:20:45,681 --> 00:20:46,841
Molly?

335
00:20:49,518 --> 00:20:50,849
Molly, he got-

336
00:20:57,627 --> 00:20:58,821
Sam...

337
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,495
Baby, hold on.

338
00:21:05,602 --> 00:21:07,536
You're going
to be OK.

339
00:21:09,706 --> 00:21:10,934
Somebody?

340
00:21:11,241 --> 00:21:12,799
Somebody?

341
00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:14,774
Somebody help us!

342
00:21:14,878 --> 00:21:16,277
Oh, Sam.

343
00:21:18,281 --> 00:21:19,612
Oh, my God.

344
00:21:19,716 --> 00:21:21,616
Oh, Sam, come on.

345
00:21:21,718 --> 00:21:23,276
Hold on, baby.

346
00:21:23,386 --> 00:21:25,684
Someone's going to come.

347
00:21:25,756 --> 00:21:28,384
You're going to be OK.

348
00:21:38,302 --> 00:21:39,894
Somebody!

349
00:21:39,971 --> 00:21:42,667
Somebody help me!

350
00:21:42,774 --> 00:21:44,765
Please, anybody!

351
00:21:44,909 --> 00:21:46,877
Help me. Please help me.

352
00:21:46,978 --> 00:21:48,946
Take it easy, all right?

353
00:21:50,581 --> 00:21:51,912
We'll help you, OK?

354
00:21:51,983 --> 00:21:54,611
Molly? Molly?

355
00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:55,811
Molly?

356
00:21:58,956 --> 00:21:59,980
OK.

357
00:22:00,258 --> 00:22:01,520
All right.
All right.

358
00:22:01,592 --> 00:22:02,786
Molly?

359
00:22:02,927 --> 00:22:04,394
What should we do?

360
00:22:13,705 --> 00:22:15,605
What's happening?

361
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,300
What's...

362
00:22:18,443 --> 00:22:19,603
Is he breathing?

363
00:22:23,382 --> 00:22:25,577
I don't know
if he's breathing.

364
00:22:26,652 --> 00:22:29,052
Don't die, Sam.
Hold on.

365
00:22:29,321 --> 00:22:31,346
Hold on, baby.
Hold on.

366
00:22:31,456 --> 00:22:32,787
Oh, my God.

367
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,441
Come on, man.

368
00:22:51,544 --> 00:22:52,841
All right.

369
00:22:52,946 --> 00:22:55,141
Here we go.

370
00:22:55,381 --> 00:22:56,973
1...

371
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,950
Come on, baby.

372
00:22:59,052 --> 00:23:01,520
Sam, don't you leave me.

373
00:23:01,621 --> 00:23:03,054
Sam, hold on!

374
00:23:04,324 --> 00:23:05,518
Sam...

375
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:06,785
Oh, Sam...

376
00:23:09,028 --> 00:23:10,359
Jesus...

377
00:23:57,078 --> 00:23:59,945
Miss Jensen, if you'll just step
this way, please.

378
00:24:17,098 --> 00:24:19,692
So, what happened
to you?

379
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:21,824
What?

380
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,870
You're new, huh?
I could tell.

381
00:24:23,972 --> 00:24:25,997
Are you talking to me?

382
00:24:26,107 --> 00:24:27,574
Relax. It ain't
like before.

383
00:24:27,676 --> 00:24:30,611
It's a whole new
ball of wax.

384
00:24:30,745 --> 00:24:32,611
Who are you?

385
00:24:32,715 --> 00:24:34,615
I'm waiting
for my wife.

386
00:24:34,717 --> 00:24:37,618
She's in the cardiac wing.
She's fighting it.

387
00:24:46,729 --> 00:24:47,991
Shot, huh?

388
00:24:48,097 --> 00:24:49,462
That'll do it every time.

389
00:24:51,067 --> 00:24:52,056
Poor bastard.

390
00:24:52,201 --> 00:24:54,795
You may as well
get used to it.

391
00:24:54,937 --> 00:24:57,269
You could be here
for a long while.

392
00:25:01,577 --> 00:25:03,909
Come here.
I'll tell you a secret.

393
00:25:04,013 --> 00:25:05,503
Doors ain't so bad.

394
00:25:05,614 --> 00:25:07,515
Zip, zap-
they ain't nothing.

395
00:25:07,617 --> 00:25:09,517
You'll see.
You'll catch on.

396
00:25:09,619 --> 00:25:11,951
This patient's fibrillating.
Let's move it.

397
00:25:12,022 --> 00:25:14,456
Give me
the paddles.

398
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:16,458
He ain't
going to make it.

399
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,528
I've seen it
a million times.

400
00:25:18,628 --> 00:25:19,959
He's a goner.

401
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,520
He's still
fibrillating.

402
00:25:21,631 --> 00:25:22,655
Clear.

403
00:25:25,268 --> 00:25:26,633
You see?

404
00:25:26,703 --> 00:25:28,034
Here they come.

405
00:25:31,975 --> 00:25:33,636
Lucky bastard.

406
00:25:33,744 --> 00:25:36,679
It could have been
the other ones.

407
00:25:36,747 --> 00:25:39,011
You never know.

408
00:25:59,303 --> 00:26:00,201
Who are-

409
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:07,539
No!

410
00:26:14,852 --> 00:26:16,183
God help me.

411
00:26:17,855 --> 00:26:19,687
Oh, God...

412
00:26:19,758 --> 00:26:21,089
help me.

413
00:26:27,266 --> 00:26:30,235
"I am sunk
in the abysmal swamp

414
00:26:30,302 --> 00:26:32,236
where there is no foothold.

415
00:26:32,304 --> 00:26:35,102
I have reached
the watery depths.

416
00:26:35,207 --> 00:26:38,142
The flood overwhelms me.

417
00:26:38,277 --> 00:26:41,735
I am wearied with calling."

418
00:26:41,814 --> 00:26:45,272
As we say farewell
to our friend Sam Wheat,

419
00:26:45,584 --> 00:26:47,916
we are reminded
of his kindness...

420
00:26:49,388 --> 00:26:51,913
his generosity,

421
00:26:52,024 --> 00:26:55,051
his buoyancy of spirit.

422
00:26:55,128 --> 00:26:56,755
All that we treasure-

423
00:26:56,863 --> 00:26:59,195
our loved ones,

424
00:26:59,299 --> 00:27:00,561
our friends,

425
00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:02,658
our body,

426
00:27:02,802 --> 00:27:05,498
our mind-

427
00:27:05,638 --> 00:27:07,970
are but on loan to us.

428
00:27:08,074 --> 00:27:11,009
We must
surrender them all.

429
00:27:11,144 --> 00:27:14,079
We are all travelers
on the same road,

430
00:27:14,147 --> 00:27:16,707
which leads
to the same end.

431
00:27:20,286 --> 00:27:23,778
As our loved one
enters eternal life,

432
00:27:23,923 --> 00:27:26,551
let us remember
that love, too, is eternal.

433
00:27:28,294 --> 00:27:30,763
That although
we will miss him,

434
00:27:30,865 --> 00:27:32,890
our love
will light the void

435
00:27:32,967 --> 00:27:34,901
and dispel the darkness.

436
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:16,801
I picked up
your shirts today.

437
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:20,073
I don't know why.

438
00:28:24,252 --> 00:28:27,915
Mr. Reynolds told me
to tell you hello.

439
00:28:30,926 --> 00:28:32,917
I broke into tears.

440
00:28:36,164 --> 00:28:39,065
It's like I think
about you every minute.

441
00:28:39,167 --> 00:28:42,331
It's like
I can still feel you.

442
00:28:52,048 --> 00:28:54,243
I'm here, Moll.

443
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:04,725
Floyd, what's
the matter, kitty?

444
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:06,192
What's the matter?

445
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:09,264
Crazy cat.

446
00:29:13,402 --> 00:29:15,097
Sam?

447
00:29:17,941 --> 00:29:19,875
That's really
stupid.

448
00:29:31,188 --> 00:29:32,678
I love this picture.

449
00:29:32,789 --> 00:29:33,721
It's great.

450
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:36,850
Office.

451
00:29:45,535 --> 00:29:47,316
Let me see that.

452
00:29:47,337 --> 00:29:48,269
It's...

453
00:29:48,338 --> 00:29:49,828
Sam's address book.

454
00:29:49,973 --> 00:29:50,905
Right.

455
00:29:57,015 --> 00:29:58,346
Dave Brubeck.
Newport, '88.

456
00:29:58,449 --> 00:29:59,939
Should I toss
them?

457
00:30:00,018 --> 00:30:00,950
No.

458
00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:04,978
No? Molly, we hated
that concert.

459
00:30:06,124 --> 00:30:09,150
Oh. You wanted
to save those?

460
00:30:09,294 --> 00:30:10,818
Rolaids?

461
00:30:10,928 --> 00:30:13,453
Molly, what
are you doing?

462
00:30:21,205 --> 00:30:24,971
I just miss him,
Carl.

463
00:30:25,076 --> 00:30:26,441
Me, too.

464
00:30:29,248 --> 00:30:30,374
Carl?

465
00:30:30,482 --> 00:30:31,380
Yeah?

466
00:30:31,483 --> 00:30:32,973
Wait a minute.
Wait.

467
00:30:33,085 --> 00:30:33,983
What?

468
00:30:34,086 --> 00:30:35,383
Not that one.

469
00:30:35,487 --> 00:30:36,977
Which? Oh, I'm sorry.

470
00:30:37,089 --> 00:30:39,387
I didn't mean to put
that on there.

471
00:30:39,525 --> 00:30:41,015
That's OK.

472
00:30:41,093 --> 00:30:43,459
Hey, Moll,
why don't you come?

473
00:30:43,562 --> 00:30:45,052
It's like summer
outside.

474
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:48,395
No, I'm really
not up for it.

475
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,400
Just for a walk.

476
00:30:50,469 --> 00:30:51,959
I don't want to.

477
00:30:52,071 --> 00:30:54,130
You can't stay in
all day.

478
00:30:54,239 --> 00:30:55,399
It's not healthy.

479
00:30:55,507 --> 00:30:57,498
Carl, I can't do it!

480
00:30:57,643 --> 00:31:00,441
Molly, you're not
the one who died.

481
00:31:02,581 --> 00:31:04,515
I'm sorry.

482
00:31:04,583 --> 00:31:06,051
Don't apologize.

483
00:31:06,186 --> 00:31:08,381
Shit.

484
00:31:12,092 --> 00:31:13,855
Maybe you're right.

485
00:31:13,993 --> 00:31:15,483
Maybe
just a short one.

486
00:31:15,595 --> 00:31:17,563
That a girl.

487
00:31:19,899 --> 00:31:21,059
I'm sorry.

488
00:31:21,167 --> 00:31:23,328
Don't worry about it.

489
00:31:23,436 --> 00:31:24,835
Molly!

490
00:32:24,499 --> 00:32:27,024
What are you
doing here?

491
00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:29,467
You bastard.

492
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,675
You son of a bitch!

493
00:32:50,459 --> 00:32:52,690
What do you want?

494
00:32:53,996 --> 00:32:55,486
Molly?

495
00:32:56,666 --> 00:32:59,464
Molly, get out!

496
00:32:59,569 --> 00:33:00,593
Oh, my God.

497
00:33:05,374 --> 00:33:08,639
No, Molly! Look,
no, no, please!

498
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,978
Molly!

499
00:33:12,081 --> 00:33:13,241
Molly,
he's got a gun!

500
00:33:14,383 --> 00:33:16,613
Hi, kitty. Hi.

501
00:33:16,719 --> 00:33:19,017
You hurt her-

502
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,342
Shit!

503
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:50,552
Is somebody there?

504
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:53,248
Hello?

505
00:33:54,725 --> 00:33:56,056
Hello?

506
00:35:10,803 --> 00:35:12,293
Oh, my God!

507
00:35:14,073 --> 00:35:15,803
Let go!
What are you doing?

508
00:35:21,147 --> 00:35:23,047
Like trains?

509
00:35:33,293 --> 00:35:35,659
Stay out! This is mine!

510
00:36:52,808 --> 00:36:54,639
Shit.

511
00:37:04,921 --> 00:37:07,389
It's me.
I couldn't get it.

512
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:09,822
She came home.

513
00:37:09,926 --> 00:37:12,394
Give me a couple
of days, man.

514
00:37:12,495 --> 00:37:13,894
I'll go back.

515
00:37:13,996 --> 00:37:15,691
Relax.

516
00:37:15,798 --> 00:37:17,288
I'll get it.

517
00:37:18,735 --> 00:37:20,259
Get what?

518
00:37:22,772 --> 00:37:24,262
Who are you?

519
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,638
What do you
want from us?

520
00:37:31,347 --> 00:37:32,644
No.

521
00:37:32,749 --> 00:37:36,685
You stay away
from her.

522
00:37:36,753 --> 00:37:38,221
Do you hear me?

523
00:37:38,355 --> 00:37:41,483
Stay away from her!

524
00:38:04,748 --> 00:38:05,874
And...

525
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:08,713
teddy bear, teddy bear,
turn around,

526
00:38:08,852 --> 00:38:10,285
teddy bear,
teddy bear,

527
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,251
touch
the ground.

528
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:44,782
Rosa Santiago?

529
00:38:50,963 --> 00:38:52,328
Please
be seated.

530
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,015
Our sister will be
with us soon.

531
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:15,877
Sister Oda Mae,

532
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:19,980
grant us the gift of
your all-seeing presence.

533
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:22,787
Appear before us
now.

534
00:39:28,435 --> 00:39:30,460
Mrs. Santiago?

535
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,604
Buenos dais.

536
00:39:32,706 --> 00:39:35,004
I'm Oda Mae Brown.

537
00:39:35,141 --> 00:39:37,632
I understand you wish
to contact your husband.

538
00:39:37,744 --> 00:39:38,642
Si.

539
00:39:38,745 --> 00:39:41,043
I believe
he'll be with us today.

540
00:39:41,147 --> 00:39:42,409
Thank you.

541
00:39:42,515 --> 00:39:43,447
Thank you.

542
00:39:43,516 --> 00:39:45,575
But you know,
Mrs. Santiago,

543
00:39:45,685 --> 00:39:48,586
there's no telling
about that other world,

544
00:39:48,722 --> 00:39:51,657
so you've got to be
a believer, Mrs. Santiago.

545
00:39:51,791 --> 00:39:53,122
Are you a believer?

546
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:56,692
Si. Si, I believe.
I believe.

547
00:39:56,796 --> 00:39:58,127
Then let us begin.

548
00:40:19,954 --> 00:40:21,114
I can't.

549
00:40:21,222 --> 00:40:24,191
I can't.
It's too difficult.

550
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:27,791
I can't make contact.
I don't feel his vi-

551
00:40:27,895 --> 00:40:29,192
No, wait!

552
00:40:29,463 --> 00:40:31,124
I'm feeling something.

553
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:36,637
Did he know someone
by the name of Anna?

554
00:40:38,273 --> 00:40:39,865
Consuelo?

555
00:40:39,975 --> 00:40:42,034
Lucita?

556
00:40:42,144 --> 00:40:43,543
Julietta?

557
00:40:43,645 --> 00:40:45,078
Josefina? Linda?

558
00:40:45,213 --> 00:40:46,111
Maria?

559
00:40:46,214 --> 00:40:48,944
¡Si! His mama!

560
00:40:49,051 --> 00:40:50,541
She is Maria!

561
00:40:50,652 --> 00:40:54,816
Yes! Praise God, I knew
he was with his mama.

562
00:40:54,923 --> 00:40:56,584
Oh, my God.

563
00:41:01,096 --> 00:41:03,690
It's too difficult.
It's two of them.

564
00:41:03,799 --> 00:41:06,097
I'm not sure
I can do that.

565
00:41:06,201 --> 00:41:07,634
It's so trying.

566
00:41:07,736 --> 00:41:10,034
Oh, I pay more.
How much?

567
00:41:10,138 --> 00:41:11,036
How much?

568
00:41:11,139 --> 00:41:12,038
$20.

569
00:41:12,141 --> 00:41:15,042
Way to go. Milk her
for every penny.

570
00:41:30,727 --> 00:41:36,188
Huh. Yes, I... I believe
we can start again.

571
00:41:48,879 --> 00:41:51,313
- Praise the Lord.
- Praise the Lord.

572
00:41:51,582 --> 00:41:55,245
- Thank you, Jesus.
- Thank you, Jesus.

573
00:42:10,701 --> 00:42:11,998
Welcome, Mrs. Santiago.

574
00:42:12,102 --> 00:42:16,129
You're fortunate today.
The spirits are churning.

575
00:42:16,206 --> 00:42:17,264
My husband?

576
00:42:17,541 --> 00:42:18,701
Have mercy!

577
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:20,174
Oh, yeah? Where?

578
00:42:22,546 --> 00:42:24,139
Julio?

579
00:42:24,249 --> 00:42:25,841
Yes!

580
00:42:25,984 --> 00:42:28,782
I feel his vibration.

581
00:42:28,887 --> 00:42:30,548
Ooh!

582
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:33,882
I see him!

583
00:42:33,992 --> 00:42:36,859
How is he?
How does he look?

584
00:42:36,961 --> 00:42:38,155
Oh, he's a handsome man.

585
00:42:40,098 --> 00:42:41,224
Handsome?

586
00:42:41,366 --> 00:42:44,767
Mrs. Santiago,
in Our Father's kingdom,

587
00:42:44,903 --> 00:42:46,734
we're all handsome.

588
00:42:46,805 --> 00:42:49,296
Oh, Julio.

589
00:42:49,407 --> 00:42:50,999
Julio's
coming towards us.

590
00:42:51,109 --> 00:42:53,873
I see him! He's coming!

591
00:42:53,945 --> 00:42:55,378
He's there!

592
00:42:58,016 --> 00:43:01,043
He's dressed
in a black suit.

593
00:43:02,154 --> 00:43:04,019
Black suit?

594
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:07,526
It could be blue.

595
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:10,151
What a crock of shit.

596
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:11,729
Who is that?

597
00:43:11,864 --> 00:43:13,729
Julio! Where are you?

598
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:14,731
Julio? Julio?

599
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,563
Did you hear it?

600
00:43:16,669 --> 00:43:18,159
Damn!
Where are you?

601
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:19,202
Julio?

602
00:43:19,271 --> 00:43:20,670
Who are you?

603
00:43:22,775 --> 00:43:24,003
You can hear me?

604
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:26,169
Don't you hear him?

605
00:43:26,278 --> 00:43:27,745
I don't believe this.

606
00:43:27,847 --> 00:43:29,838
Hey, you,
my name's Sam Wheat.

607
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:32,917
Can you hear me?
Sam Wheat. Say my name.

608
00:43:33,052 --> 00:43:34,280
Leave me alone!

609
00:43:34,386 --> 00:43:35,752
Say it! Sam Wheat!

610
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:38,222
Talk to me, Oda Mae.
Say something!

611
00:43:38,325 --> 00:43:39,724
Sam Wheat!

612
00:43:41,795 --> 00:43:43,763
Jesus.

613
00:43:43,864 --> 00:43:45,764
- Sam Wheat?
- Sam Wheat?

614
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:47,163
I swear,
no more cheating.

615
00:43:47,267 --> 00:43:49,167
I'll do anything.
I'll do penance,

616
00:43:49,269 --> 00:43:51,169
but make that guy
go away!

617
00:43:51,271 --> 00:43:52,169
No way.

618
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,242
It's OK.

619
00:44:02,983 --> 00:44:04,314
It's OK.

620
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:07,786
All right, sister.

621
00:44:07,888 --> 00:44:09,355
Thank you.

622
00:44:09,656 --> 00:44:11,716
Yeah, you're
all right.

623
00:44:11,826 --> 00:44:13,760
My mother
and my mother's mother

624
00:44:13,828 --> 00:44:15,159
both had the gift.

625
00:44:15,263 --> 00:44:18,755
They always said I had it,
but I never did.

626
00:44:18,866 --> 00:44:20,197
I never had it.

627
00:44:20,301 --> 00:44:22,201
They told me
all about it.

628
00:44:22,303 --> 00:44:26,205
But now that I got it,
I don't think I want it.

629
00:44:26,307 --> 00:44:27,797
Go away.
Find somebody else.

630
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:30,400
Somebody else?
You're out of your mind.

631
00:44:30,678 --> 00:44:32,009
I'm getting there fast.

632
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:34,410
She hit her head
harder than we think.

633
00:44:34,682 --> 00:44:37,776
She was talking to nobody
before she hit her head.

634
00:44:37,885 --> 00:44:39,216
Sister can do that.

635
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,844
Where exactly are you?

636
00:44:40,988 --> 00:44:42,319
Standing
right beside you.

637
00:44:45,326 --> 00:44:47,386
Well, honey,
we're right here.

638
00:44:47,496 --> 00:44:48,986
Are you white?

639
00:44:49,064 --> 00:44:50,031
What?

640
00:44:50,165 --> 00:44:51,029
White?

641
00:44:51,166 --> 00:44:52,463
You're white,
aren't you?

642
00:44:52,768 --> 00:44:54,065
Know what I think?

643
00:44:54,169 --> 00:44:55,898
I'll call the doctor
right now.

644
00:44:56,004 --> 00:44:58,302
I knew it.
A white guy. Why me?

645
00:44:58,407 --> 00:45:00,773
Listen, damn it.
You're going to help me.

646
00:45:00,876 --> 00:45:02,707
There's a woman
named Molly Jensen.

647
00:45:02,811 --> 00:45:04,142
She's in terrible danger.

648
00:45:04,213 --> 00:45:06,875
The man who killed me
broke into our apartment,

649
00:45:06,982 --> 00:45:08,916
and he's going
to go back.

650
00:45:09,017 --> 00:45:10,348
You've got
to warn her.

651
00:45:10,419 --> 00:45:13,354
What makes you think
she'll listen to me?

652
00:45:13,455 --> 00:45:15,355
It's just a phone call.

653
00:45:17,226 --> 00:45:18,318
Look...

654
00:45:20,729 --> 00:45:22,698
you're all I've got.

655
00:45:22,799 --> 00:45:25,825
Now, I'm not leaving
until you help me.

656
00:45:25,935 --> 00:45:28,870
I don't care
how long it takes,

657
00:45:28,938 --> 00:45:30,872
'cause I can talk
forever.

658
00:45:44,153 --> 00:45:45,347
Hello?

659
00:45:45,455 --> 00:45:47,389
Uh, hi. Is this
Molly Jensen?

660
00:45:47,457 --> 00:45:48,389
Yes.

661
00:45:48,458 --> 00:45:49,948
My name's Oda Mae Brown.

662
00:45:50,059 --> 00:45:51,959
I'm a spiritual reader
and advisor.

663
00:45:52,061 --> 00:45:55,121
A friend of yours gave me
a message for you.

664
00:45:55,231 --> 00:45:57,723
I know this sounds crazy,
but it's not.

665
00:45:57,835 --> 00:46:00,429
You got to believe me.
Just don't be afraid.

666
00:46:00,738 --> 00:46:02,501
Who is this?

667
00:46:02,773 --> 00:46:05,435
I got a message
from Sam.

668
00:46:05,542 --> 00:46:07,772
What?

669
00:46:07,878 --> 00:46:10,972
Sam Wheat?
He asked me to call.

670
00:46:12,082 --> 00:46:13,413
I told you.

671
00:46:13,484 --> 00:46:14,416
Go there.

672
00:46:14,485 --> 00:46:16,419
Forget it.
I'm not going anywhere.

673
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:19,387
I don't care
what you do.

674
00:46:19,456 --> 00:46:21,720
"Second verse
Same as the first"

675
00:46:21,825 --> 00:46:23,952
"I'm 'En-er-y the Eighth
I am"

676
00:46:24,061 --> 00:46:26,256
"'En-er-y the Eighth
I am, I am"

677
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:28,855
"I got married
to the widow next door"

678
00:46:28,966 --> 00:46:31,366
"She's been married
seven times before"

679
00:46:31,502 --> 00:46:33,129
"And ev'ry one
was an 'En-er-y"

680
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:34,738
"'En-er-y"

681
00:46:34,839 --> 00:46:35,771
"Wouldn't have
a Willy or a Sam"

682
00:46:35,874 --> 00:46:37,102
"No, sir"

683
00:46:37,175 --> 00:46:39,473
"I'm her eighth old man
I'm 'En-er-y"

684
00:46:39,577 --> 00:46:42,307
"'En-er-y the Eighth
I am, I am"

685
00:46:42,414 --> 00:46:44,439
"'En-er-y the Eighth
I am"

686
00:46:44,549 --> 00:46:47,109
"Second verse
Same as the first"

687
00:46:47,218 --> 00:46:49,778
"I'm 'En-er-y the Eighth
I am"

688
00:46:49,888 --> 00:46:52,288
"'En-er-y the Eighth
I am, I am"

689
00:46:52,424 --> 00:46:55,120
"I got married
to the widow next door-"

690
00:46:55,226 --> 00:46:57,160
All right! All right!
Stop singing!

691
00:46:57,228 --> 00:46:59,093
I'll go anywhere
you want to,

692
00:46:59,197 --> 00:47:01,358
just don't sing anymore.

693
00:47:04,502 --> 00:47:05,935
I can't believe this.

694
00:47:06,071 --> 00:47:08,403
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

695
00:47:08,506 --> 00:47:10,407
What am I doing
down here?

696
00:47:10,509 --> 00:47:12,943
I never come downtown.
I hate downtown.

697
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:14,979
She's probably
not even there.

698
00:47:15,081 --> 00:47:16,548
Where are you?

699
00:47:17,883 --> 00:47:19,316
Woof.

700
00:47:19,418 --> 00:47:21,409
Which building is it?

701
00:47:22,521 --> 00:47:24,011
Uh, push 3.

702
00:47:25,524 --> 00:47:27,116
See? Nobody's there.

703
00:47:27,259 --> 00:47:28,590
She's there.
Just wait.

704
00:47:28,861 --> 00:47:31,159
I did everything
I said I'd do.

705
00:47:31,263 --> 00:47:32,594
I pressed
the button.

706
00:47:32,865 --> 00:47:34,298
She's not there.
I'm going.

707
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,924
"99 bottles of beer
on the wall"

708
00:47:36,035 --> 00:47:37,059
"99 bottles of beer"

709
00:47:37,203 --> 00:47:38,431
"Take one down
Pass it around-"

710
00:47:38,571 --> 00:47:40,300
Don't sing, all right?

711
00:47:40,439 --> 00:47:41,337
Hello?

712
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,873
Molly-

713
00:47:43,008 --> 00:47:44,339
Shh! She can't hear you.

714
00:47:44,443 --> 00:47:45,877
Hi, I'm Oda Mae.

715
00:47:46,012 --> 00:47:48,913
I called you about
your friend Sam Wheat?

716
00:47:50,016 --> 00:47:51,881
I told you.

717
00:47:58,592 --> 00:48:00,822
Hey, Molly!
Molly Jensen.

718
00:48:00,927 --> 00:48:03,794
I know you're up there.
I know you hear me.

719
00:48:03,897 --> 00:48:06,195
I'm down here.
Sam wants to talk to you.

720
00:48:06,299 --> 00:48:08,267
This is for real.

721
00:48:08,368 --> 00:48:10,268
Remember the starfish
in Montego Bay?

722
00:48:10,404 --> 00:48:13,532
How would I know that
if he wasn't here?

723
00:48:13,673 --> 00:48:16,141
Hey, Molly, I know
about the green underwear

724
00:48:16,276 --> 00:48:18,176
that you wrote
your name on.

725
00:48:18,278 --> 00:48:21,373
I'd never get over that,
I tell you that.

726
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:24,417
I know about
the picture in Reno.

727
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:26,043
Hey, Molly!

728
00:48:26,154 --> 00:48:29,487
Ask her about the sweater
she knitted in the closet

729
00:48:29,624 --> 00:48:31,091
that's too big.

730
00:48:31,192 --> 00:48:35,526
He asked me to remind you
of the sweater in the closet

731
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:37,427
that you knitted
that's too big.

732
00:48:37,532 --> 00:48:39,625
Four sizes.

733
00:48:41,169 --> 00:48:43,501
Hey, you hear me
talking to you?

734
00:48:43,638 --> 00:48:45,105
I hear you.

735
00:48:45,206 --> 00:48:46,901
Shut up. Nobody's
talking to you.

736
00:48:47,008 --> 00:48:48,339
Ever hear of a phone?

737
00:48:48,443 --> 00:48:50,172
Want to kiss my butt?

738
00:48:50,278 --> 00:48:52,610
I'm not staying
down here all day.

739
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,612
Thank God.

740
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:55,171
Aw, man, shut up.

741
00:48:55,283 --> 00:48:57,616
Molly! I'm going
to count to 3,

742
00:48:57,686 --> 00:49:00,052
and I'm out of here.

743
00:49:00,122 --> 00:49:01,384
1, 2, 3.

744
00:49:03,392 --> 00:49:04,882
No, Oda, wait.

745
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:05,892
No.

746
00:49:05,961 --> 00:49:07,223
It's Molly.

747
00:49:13,902 --> 00:49:15,392
Molly?

748
00:49:18,073 --> 00:49:20,439
I'm Oda Mae Brown.

749
00:49:24,546 --> 00:49:26,377
I don't know you or Sam,

750
00:49:26,482 --> 00:49:28,973
but let me tell you
what he did.

751
00:49:29,051 --> 00:49:30,985
He kept me up all night

752
00:49:31,053 --> 00:49:32,646
singing I'm Henry
The Eighth, I Am.

753
00:49:32,755 --> 00:49:36,418
That's how he got me
to go out with him.

754
00:49:36,526 --> 00:49:37,720
Look, I'm sorry.

755
00:49:38,027 --> 00:49:39,927
I just-
I just don't believe

756
00:49:40,029 --> 00:49:43,123
in this life
after death stuff.

757
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:44,530
Well, tell her
she's wrong.

758
00:49:44,634 --> 00:49:47,159
He says
you're wrong.

759
00:49:47,237 --> 00:49:49,171
You're talking to him
right now?

760
00:49:49,239 --> 00:49:52,470
He just asked me to tell you
that you're wrong.

761
00:49:52,575 --> 00:49:54,042
So where is he?

762
00:49:54,177 --> 00:49:57,544
I can't see him.
I can only hear him.

763
00:49:57,647 --> 00:50:00,081
I'm right here.

764
00:50:00,216 --> 00:50:02,377
That doesn't help,
Sam.

765
00:50:02,485 --> 00:50:05,511
I'm holding
her hand.

766
00:50:05,588 --> 00:50:07,715
He says he's
holding your hand.

767
00:50:17,768 --> 00:50:19,099
What are you doing?

768
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:23,101
What do you think
you're doing to me?

769
00:50:23,207 --> 00:50:26,472
If you think I'm here for
my health, you're crazy.

770
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:29,477
Sam's dead, OK?
He's dead.

771
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:31,480
Tell her
I love her.

772
00:50:31,582 --> 00:50:33,516
He says
he loves you.

773
00:50:35,152 --> 00:50:37,586
Sam would
never say that.

774
00:50:37,688 --> 00:50:38,620
Say ditto.

775
00:50:38,689 --> 00:50:40,179
What the hell
is ditto?

776
00:50:40,291 --> 00:50:41,417
Ditto!

777
00:51:10,655 --> 00:51:12,418
To tell you
the truth,

778
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:14,822
I don't know how
I'm doing this.

779
00:51:15,093 --> 00:51:16,424
Confidentially,
nothing like this

780
00:51:16,494 --> 00:51:18,428
has ever happened
to me before.

781
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:19,862
I mean, nothing.

782
00:51:20,132 --> 00:51:21,861
Now I can't
turn it off.

783
00:51:24,236 --> 00:51:26,295
Is this him?
Is this you?

784
00:51:26,405 --> 00:51:27,303
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

785
00:51:27,406 --> 00:51:29,169
Huh. Cute.

786
00:51:29,275 --> 00:51:30,799
White,
but cute.

787
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:33,377
What I don't
understand is,

788
00:51:33,479 --> 00:51:35,174
why did he come back?

789
00:51:35,314 --> 00:51:36,645
I don't know.

790
00:51:36,716 --> 00:51:38,183
Why is he
still here?

791
00:51:38,317 --> 00:51:40,217
He's stuck,
that's what it is.

792
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:41,650
He's in between
worlds.

793
00:51:41,721 --> 00:51:43,245
You know,
it happens sometimes

794
00:51:43,356 --> 00:51:45,688
that the spirit gets
yanked out so quick

795
00:51:45,758 --> 00:51:47,248
that the essence
still feels

796
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:48,691
it has work to do.

797
00:51:48,761 --> 00:51:50,194
Would you stop rambling?

798
00:51:50,296 --> 00:51:51,593
I'm just answering
her question.

799
00:51:51,731 --> 00:51:53,198
He's got
an attitude now.

800
00:51:53,299 --> 00:51:55,291
I don't have an attitude.

801
00:51:55,435 --> 00:51:57,335
Yes, you do
have an attitude.

802
00:51:57,437 --> 00:51:58,699
We're having
a little discussion.

803
00:51:58,805 --> 00:52:00,602
If you didn't have
a attitude,

804
00:52:00,707 --> 00:52:02,470
you wouldn't have
raised your voice.

805
00:52:02,576 --> 00:52:04,066
God damn it,
Oda Mae-

806
00:52:04,211 --> 00:52:05,473
Don't you god damn me.

807
00:52:05,612 --> 00:52:07,807
Don't you take
the Lord's name in vain.

808
00:52:07,914 --> 00:52:09,279
Would you relax?

809
00:52:09,383 --> 00:52:11,283
You relax.
You're the dead guy.

810
00:52:11,385 --> 00:52:13,285
Want me to help?
You apologize.

811
00:52:13,387 --> 00:52:14,285
Jesus Christ!

812
00:52:14,388 --> 00:52:15,446
I'm leaving.

813
00:52:15,555 --> 00:52:17,853
Nobody talks to me like that,
you understand?

814
00:52:17,924 --> 00:52:19,414
Now, you better
apologize.

815
00:52:19,526 --> 00:52:20,857
I'm sorry.

816
00:52:20,927 --> 00:52:21,859
I apologize.

817
00:52:21,928 --> 00:52:23,486
OK?

818
00:52:23,597 --> 00:52:26,361
Now, would you
sit down?

819
00:52:26,466 --> 00:52:27,364
Please?

820
00:52:27,467 --> 00:52:29,594
He's apologized.

821
00:52:30,805 --> 00:52:33,740
I need you to tell
Molly what I'm saying,

822
00:52:33,808 --> 00:52:36,743
but you have to tell her
word for word.

823
00:52:36,844 --> 00:52:40,302
Yes. He wants me to tell you
what he's saying

824
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:42,541
word for word.

825
00:52:47,488 --> 00:52:48,785
Molly, you're in danger.

826
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:51,791
You can't just
blurt it out like that.

827
00:52:51,893 --> 00:52:53,588
And quit moving around,
will you?

828
00:52:53,695 --> 00:52:55,185
You're making me dizzy.

829
00:52:55,296 --> 00:52:57,696
I'll just tell her
in my own way.

830
00:52:57,832 --> 00:53:01,324
Molly, you in danger,
girl.

831
00:53:01,436 --> 00:53:03,370
What are you
talking about?

832
00:53:03,438 --> 00:53:05,531
I know the man
who killed me.

833
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,165
He knows
who killed him.

834
00:53:07,276 --> 00:53:09,836
His name's Willy Lopez.
I know where he lives.

835
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:11,878
He's a Puerto Rican,
Willy Lopez.

836
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,413
He knows
where he lives.

837
00:53:13,482 --> 00:53:14,414
Write it down.

838
00:53:14,483 --> 00:53:15,814
You write it down.

839
00:53:15,918 --> 00:53:17,385
I ain't no
damn secretary.

840
00:53:17,486 --> 00:53:18,418
Just do it!

841
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,851
Argh!

842
00:53:19,955 --> 00:53:22,389
He's so testy.

843
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:25,426
What is it you
want me to write?

844
00:53:25,527 --> 00:53:28,325
It's 303 Prospect Place,
apartment 4-D.

845
00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:29,761
303 Prospect Place?

846
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:30,764
Yeah.

847
00:53:30,866 --> 00:53:32,891
That's my
neighborhood.

848
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:34,935
Molly, he's got
my wallet,

849
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:36,493
he's got my key,

850
00:53:36,605 --> 00:53:37,936
and he was
in here.

851
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:41,373
He's got his wallet
and key and was here.

852
00:53:41,477 --> 00:53:43,378
Yesterday after your
walk with Carl,

853
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,812
you talked to Floyd,
took off your clothes-

854
00:53:45,915 --> 00:53:47,382
All right,
all right.

855
00:53:47,517 --> 00:53:49,712
When you came in
after your walk with Carl,

856
00:53:49,819 --> 00:53:51,753
he saw
everything.

857
00:53:51,855 --> 00:53:54,323
Go to the police.
It was a setup.

858
00:53:54,424 --> 00:53:56,358
I was murdered.

859
00:53:56,459 --> 00:53:59,428
He says go to the police.
He was murdered.

860
00:53:59,529 --> 00:54:00,757
There's somebody
else involved-

861
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:03,663
I don't want no more
to do with this.

862
00:54:03,767 --> 00:54:05,257
Where are you going?

863
00:54:05,368 --> 00:54:08,303
I'm leaving, I did everything
I said I'd do.

864
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:10,430
And don't be
following me.

865
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:12,440
I'm finished.
I mean it.

866
00:54:12,509 --> 00:54:14,841
Have a nice life.
Have a nice death.

867
00:54:14,944 --> 00:54:15,933
Goodbye.

868
00:54:18,649 --> 00:54:21,015
Molly, there is no one
on earth besides you

869
00:54:21,285 --> 00:54:24,413
who wants this
to be true more than me,

870
00:54:24,522 --> 00:54:26,786
but you got to be
rational about this.

871
00:54:26,891 --> 00:54:29,951
Sam is no more
in this room than-

872
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:35,657
Look, I understand the
need to hang on to him,

873
00:54:35,766 --> 00:54:38,735
I really do,
but this is absurd.

874
00:54:38,836 --> 00:54:42,829
I know this seems absurd,
but it had to be real.

875
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:44,874
You believed some
fortune-teller from Brooklyn

876
00:54:44,942 --> 00:54:46,933
who shows up
at your door?

877
00:54:47,044 --> 00:54:49,945
I watched her have
a conversation with him.

878
00:54:50,047 --> 00:54:52,311
I don't buy it, Moll,
not for a minute.

879
00:54:52,449 --> 00:54:54,611
What about the things
she knew?

880
00:54:54,753 --> 00:54:56,311
What things?

881
00:54:56,454 --> 00:55:00,049
The photo Sam took of me
on our trip to Reno.

882
00:55:00,325 --> 00:55:01,917
Carl, we were alone.

883
00:55:02,027 --> 00:55:05,485
And the green underwear
that I wrote my name in.

884
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:11,260
She said Sam knew
who killed him.

885
00:55:11,403 --> 00:55:14,668
Yeah, that he
was set up.

886
00:55:14,739 --> 00:55:16,707
This is getting
deranged.

887
00:55:16,775 --> 00:55:18,265
We're off
the deep end.

888
00:55:18,376 --> 00:55:20,537
She had a name
and an address-

889
00:55:20,612 --> 00:55:21,544
Willy Lopez.

890
00:55:21,613 --> 00:55:23,945
303 Prospect Place,
apartment 4-D.

891
00:55:25,483 --> 00:55:26,814
This is sick.

892
00:55:26,918 --> 00:55:28,408
Oh, Carl.

893
00:55:28,553 --> 00:55:30,488
This is really sick.

894
00:55:31,624 --> 00:55:32,556
Oh, God.

895
00:55:32,692 --> 00:55:34,023
Molly, I don't
understand

896
00:55:34,126 --> 00:55:36,026
how you could-
you could...

897
00:55:38,698 --> 00:55:40,598
swallow this crap.
I mean...

898
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:43,032
this guy
may not even exist.

899
00:55:43,135 --> 00:55:46,070
Maybe she's just
trying to use you

900
00:55:46,172 --> 00:55:48,732
to set someone up.

901
00:55:48,875 --> 00:55:50,843
You're right.

902
00:55:50,977 --> 00:55:52,444
You're absolutely right.

903
00:55:52,545 --> 00:55:55,446
That's what
I got to find out.

904
00:55:55,548 --> 00:55:57,880
What do you mean,
find out?

905
00:55:58,017 --> 00:56:01,077
She said Sam wants me
to go to the police.

906
00:56:01,387 --> 00:56:03,719
Sam wants you to
go to the police?

907
00:56:03,823 --> 00:56:06,588
Jesus, Moll. Are you
out of your mind?

908
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:08,992
What are you going
to tell the police?

909
00:56:09,096 --> 00:56:10,586
That some
storefront psychic

910
00:56:10,664 --> 00:56:12,996
has been communing
with the dead?

911
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:15,591
Do you know what
that sounds like?

912
00:56:15,669 --> 00:56:18,001
You're talking ghosts here,
for Christ's sake.

913
00:56:19,806 --> 00:56:20,704
I'm sorry.

914
00:56:20,807 --> 00:56:23,571
This stuff just really
gets to me,

915
00:56:23,677 --> 00:56:24,575
you know?

916
00:56:24,678 --> 00:56:26,976
It's OK if you
don't believe me.

917
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,570
I'm trying to, Molly.

918
00:56:32,152 --> 00:56:33,744
Look...

919
00:56:33,887 --> 00:56:36,788
if it'll make you
feel any better,

920
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:41,021
I'll go check
this out, OK?

921
00:56:41,129 --> 00:56:44,030
I want you to try
and get some sleep.

922
00:56:44,132 --> 00:56:45,030
OK?

923
00:56:45,133 --> 00:56:46,998
All right.

924
00:56:48,136 --> 00:56:50,036
I'll call you
in the morning.

925
00:56:50,138 --> 00:56:51,036
OK.

926
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:20,160
Be careful.

927
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:34,981
Carl.

928
00:57:35,084 --> 00:57:37,985
What the hell
are you doing here?

929
00:57:39,288 --> 00:57:41,188
Who you been
talking to, Willy?

930
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:43,724
"Talking to"?
What the hell do you mean?

931
00:57:43,859 --> 00:57:46,054
Some woman knows
all about you, everything.

932
00:57:46,128 --> 00:57:48,062
Where's she
getting it from?

933
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:50,621
I haven't said
a word to anybody.

934
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:53,066
She knows your name
and where you live.

935
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:55,604
A lot of women
know where I live.

936
00:57:55,705 --> 00:57:57,605
This is not a joke.

937
00:57:57,707 --> 00:57:59,641
She knows
about the murder.

938
00:57:59,743 --> 00:58:02,041
I want you
to find this bitch,

939
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:03,635
whoever she is,

940
00:58:03,747 --> 00:58:05,647
and I want you to-

941
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:09,882
Just get rid
of her, OK?

942
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:14,480
I've got $4 million stuck
in a god damn computer.

943
00:58:14,624 --> 00:58:16,922
If I don't get
those codes,

944
00:58:17,027 --> 00:58:19,928
if that money is not
transferred soon...

945
00:58:22,632 --> 00:58:24,122
I'm...

946
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:25,223
dead.

947
00:58:25,301 --> 00:58:26,791
We're both dead.

948
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:29,168
Why not tell them
you only launder money

949
00:58:29,273 --> 00:58:30,763
the first of the month?

950
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:32,672
What the hell
is wrong with you?

951
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:35,142
Is everything a joke?

952
00:58:35,279 --> 00:58:36,940
You killed a man.

953
00:58:37,081 --> 00:58:38,070
You were supposed
to steal his wallet.

954
00:58:38,215 --> 00:58:40,649
- Was that a joke?
- I did you a favor.

955
00:58:40,751 --> 00:58:42,082
That was a freebie.

956
00:58:43,287 --> 00:58:46,518
Look, these are
drug dealers, OK?

957
00:58:46,657 --> 00:58:48,989
Just don't blow this
for me.

958
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:51,927
I've risked my job.
I could go to jail.

959
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:55,192
$80,000 of that money
is mine.

960
00:58:58,569 --> 00:58:59,797
Look, just...

961
00:58:59,904 --> 00:59:02,566
let me have the key
to Sam's apartment.

962
00:59:02,673 --> 00:59:05,234
I'll get the address book
myself, OK?

963
00:59:31,169 --> 00:59:33,603
You god damn bastard!

964
00:59:33,705 --> 00:59:34,694
Why?

965
00:59:34,806 --> 00:59:37,240
Why? You were
my friend!

966
00:59:39,645 --> 00:59:42,011
I had a life,
god damn you.

967
00:59:42,148 --> 00:59:43,809
I had a life!

968
00:59:52,859 --> 00:59:56,124
Look, I don't even believe
in this stuff myself.

969
00:59:56,229 --> 00:59:57,696
But she was real.

970
00:59:57,797 --> 01:00:01,392
You think I'd come down here
if it wasn't real?

971
01:00:02,802 --> 01:00:07,135
You know, you told me if
I had any new information

972
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:08,730
that I should come.

973
01:00:08,808 --> 01:00:10,139
So here I am.

974
01:00:14,313 --> 01:00:16,248
I know
how this sounds.

975
01:00:16,316 --> 01:00:18,250
I hear myself
saying it,

976
01:00:18,318 --> 01:00:20,252
and I want
to cringe.

977
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:23,289
But this woman knew things
she couldn't have known.

978
01:00:23,357 --> 01:00:25,848
Things Sam
only said to me.

979
01:00:25,993 --> 01:00:28,985
OK, according to this
psychic lady,

980
01:00:29,129 --> 01:00:33,463
there are ghosts and spirits
all over the place

981
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:35,463
watching us
all the time?

982
01:00:39,239 --> 01:00:42,174
Hell, I'm never going
to get undressed again.

983
01:00:42,242 --> 01:00:43,174
Excuse me.

984
01:00:43,243 --> 01:00:46,178
I got more
important things to do.

985
01:00:57,091 --> 01:00:59,355
The guy's name
is Willy Lopez.

986
01:00:59,494 --> 01:01:02,827
All I'm asking you to do
is check it out.

987
01:01:02,964 --> 01:01:04,295
OK. Wait here.

988
01:01:04,365 --> 01:01:08,096
Let me see if the guy's
got a record, all right?

989
01:01:08,203 --> 01:01:09,932
Great.

990
01:02:12,435 --> 01:02:13,993
What are you doing?

991
01:02:14,104 --> 01:02:16,129
Where's the file
on Willy Lopez?

992
01:02:16,239 --> 01:02:17,729
There isn't one.

993
01:02:17,807 --> 01:02:19,741
He was probably
some old boyfriend

994
01:02:19,809 --> 01:02:22,141
she was trying
to get even with.

995
01:02:22,245 --> 01:02:24,145
This psychic woman's
got a record

996
01:02:24,247 --> 01:02:26,738
that goes back
a long way.

997
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:27,748
1967,

998
01:02:27,851 --> 01:02:29,341
Shreveport,

999
01:02:29,452 --> 01:02:30,476
forgery...

1000
01:02:30,787 --> 01:02:33,119
selling false I.D.

1001
01:02:33,256 --> 01:02:35,884
Served one year, 1971.

1002
01:02:35,992 --> 01:02:38,860
Baton Rouge,
arrested for fraud.

1003
01:02:38,996 --> 01:02:43,057
Numbers racketeering,
served 10 months, 1974.

1004
01:02:43,167 --> 01:02:44,600
Look,
this is impossible.

1005
01:02:44,835 --> 01:02:47,030
It goes on and on.

1006
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:49,038
She knew things,
private things.

1007
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:51,540
Now, how could she
have known all that?

1008
01:02:51,642 --> 01:02:54,133
A lot of times
they read the obits.

1009
01:02:54,211 --> 01:02:57,476
She just had to see
the word "banker"- boom.

1010
01:02:57,548 --> 01:02:59,982
Hell, they even go
through your... garbage

1011
01:03:00,084 --> 01:03:02,075
to find things
they can use-

1012
01:03:02,219 --> 01:03:03,550
letters, old papers.

1013
01:03:03,788 --> 01:03:05,119
It doesn't take much.

1014
01:03:06,223 --> 01:03:07,121
No.

1015
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:10,817
It was real.

1016
01:03:13,531 --> 01:03:15,523
She knew about a...

1017
01:03:15,834 --> 01:03:17,131
a sweater I knitted.

1018
01:03:19,271 --> 01:03:20,533
And songs we sang.

1019
01:03:25,577 --> 01:03:27,841
Our trip
to Montego Bay.

1020
01:03:30,349 --> 01:03:31,407
I'm sorry.

1021
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:34,018
I know this is hard.

1022
01:03:34,119 --> 01:03:36,451
People want so much
to believe.

1023
01:03:36,555 --> 01:03:37,453
They're grieving,

1024
01:03:37,556 --> 01:03:38,887
they're vulnerable...

1025
01:03:40,258 --> 01:03:42,385
and they will
give anything

1026
01:03:42,494 --> 01:03:43,984
for one last moment.

1027
01:03:44,062 --> 01:03:45,393
Believe me.

1028
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:48,328
These people know
what they're doing.

1029
01:03:48,433 --> 01:03:50,868
I know
how you must feel,

1030
01:03:51,003 --> 01:03:53,904
but you know
you can press charges.

1031
01:03:57,610 --> 01:03:58,577
No.

1032
01:04:02,515 --> 01:04:03,413
Thank you.

1033
01:04:18,097 --> 01:04:20,361
Oh, God,
let this be it.

1034
01:04:33,113 --> 01:04:34,045
Yes.

1035
01:04:46,326 --> 01:04:47,258
Hello.

1036
01:04:47,327 --> 01:04:48,658
Eddie? It's Carl Bruner.

1037
01:04:48,929 --> 01:04:49,657
What's up?

1038
01:04:49,930 --> 01:04:50,658
Everything's fine.

1039
01:04:50,964 --> 01:04:52,261
Just, we're all set.

1040
01:04:52,366 --> 01:04:55,233
Let me know what
you want me to do.

1041
01:04:55,335 --> 01:04:57,235
Want you to
transfer the money

1042
01:04:57,337 --> 01:04:58,634
from the 12
separate accounts

1043
01:04:58,739 --> 01:04:59,763
into a single account
under the name Rita Miller.

1044
01:05:01,209 --> 01:05:02,540
OK.

1045
01:05:02,610 --> 01:05:04,544
Tomorrow at five minutes
before closing,

1046
01:05:04,612 --> 01:05:06,443
3:55 pm,

1047
01:05:06,548 --> 01:05:10,450
transfer the full account to
the First Island Bank of Nassau,

1048
01:05:10,552 --> 01:05:13,248
registry number
486-9580.

1049
01:05:13,388 --> 01:05:15,288
Call us when it's done.

1050
01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:16,880
OK. I've got it.

1051
01:05:16,958 --> 01:05:18,391
Just tell Mr. Balistrari

1052
01:05:18,526 --> 01:05:21,290
that there won't be
any more problems, OK?

1053
01:05:21,396 --> 01:05:22,886
Yeah. I'll do that.

1054
01:05:22,964 --> 01:05:23,896
Thank you.

1055
01:05:23,998 --> 01:05:25,295
Good work, Carl.

1056
01:06:24,794 --> 01:06:27,285
Molly, why
can't you hear me?

1057
01:06:27,364 --> 01:06:28,991
I need you.

1058
01:06:41,211 --> 01:06:42,542
Who is it?

1059
01:06:42,612 --> 01:06:44,102
It's Carl, Molly.

1060
01:06:44,214 --> 01:06:45,181
No.

1061
01:06:45,282 --> 01:06:46,613
Don't open it,
Molly.

1062
01:06:46,716 --> 01:06:48,207
He's a murderer.

1063
01:06:48,286 --> 01:06:49,218
Hi.

1064
01:06:49,287 --> 01:06:50,219
Hey.

1065
01:06:50,288 --> 01:06:51,619
I know it's late.

1066
01:06:51,722 --> 01:06:53,485
I'm sorry
to disturb you.

1067
01:06:53,591 --> 01:06:56,151
I've been thinking
about you all day,

1068
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:59,559
and I feel really lousy
about what happened last night.

1069
01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:00,995
This supernatural
thing just-

1070
01:07:01,098 --> 01:07:03,157
Don't worry about it.
It's OK.

1071
01:07:03,267 --> 01:07:04,427
No, it's not.

1072
01:07:04,535 --> 01:07:07,470
You needed me to hear you,
and I didn't.

1073
01:07:07,572 --> 01:07:10,473
I wasn't there for you,
and that was...

1074
01:07:10,575 --> 01:07:12,202
that was wrong.

1075
01:07:12,310 --> 01:07:13,641
It's just, I...

1076
01:07:15,279 --> 01:07:16,610
I just-

1077
01:07:16,714 --> 01:07:19,683
I want you to know
that I'm your friend.

1078
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:21,274
Thanks, Carl.

1079
01:07:21,385 --> 01:07:23,216
You were never
our friend.

1080
01:07:23,287 --> 01:07:25,620
That really means
a lot to me.

1081
01:07:25,757 --> 01:07:28,385
Me, too. I brought you
some Japanese apple pears.

1082
01:07:28,527 --> 01:07:30,017
I know you like them.

1083
01:07:31,763 --> 01:07:32,661
Thanks.

1084
01:07:32,764 --> 01:07:34,231
That's very sweet.

1085
01:07:34,333 --> 01:07:36,528
Could I come in
for a second?

1086
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:39,069
It's just been
one of those days.

1087
01:07:39,171 --> 01:07:40,331
Maybe some coffee?

1088
01:07:40,472 --> 01:07:41,666
Yeah. Come on in.

1089
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:43,434
No, Molly.

1090
01:07:43,575 --> 01:07:45,475
You seem a little tense.

1091
01:07:45,577 --> 01:07:47,067
Are you OK?

1092
01:07:47,179 --> 01:07:48,510
No. I'm fine.

1093
01:07:48,614 --> 01:07:51,515
It's just-
What can I tell you?

1094
01:07:51,617 --> 01:07:53,107
It's been tough.

1095
01:07:53,185 --> 01:07:55,415
It just still hurts
so much.

1096
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:56,817
You lying snake.

1097
01:07:56,922 --> 01:07:59,790
And on top of it,
it's stuff at work.

1098
01:08:00,059 --> 01:08:02,118
They've given me
my own accounts,

1099
01:08:02,261 --> 01:08:03,558
which is good,

1100
01:08:03,663 --> 01:08:07,155
but I just haven't really
had time to adjust,

1101
01:08:07,266 --> 01:08:09,063
kind of absorb
everything.

1102
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:14,601
It's no big deal.

1103
01:08:17,610 --> 01:08:18,508
Yeah.

1104
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:27,820
Can I have just
a little more cream?

1105
01:08:28,888 --> 01:08:30,082
Yeah.

1106
01:08:31,491 --> 01:08:32,549
Oh, shit.

1107
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:35,160
Jesus. I can't believe
I did that.

1108
01:08:35,262 --> 01:08:36,456
Are you all right?

1109
01:08:36,563 --> 01:08:38,497
Yeah, I'm fine.

1110
01:08:38,565 --> 01:08:39,463
Oh, God.

1111
01:08:39,566 --> 01:08:41,830
Let me throw that
in the washer.

1112
01:08:41,935 --> 01:08:44,733
Don't worry about it.
It's OK. It's just...

1113
01:08:44,872 --> 01:08:46,339
You want
another shirt?

1114
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:48,874
No. It'll dry.
It'll just take a minute.

1115
01:08:48,976 --> 01:08:50,443
There you go.

1116
01:08:53,681 --> 01:08:54,943
Where were you today?

1117
01:08:55,215 --> 01:08:58,241
I thought you were going
to come into the bank

1118
01:08:58,352 --> 01:08:59,683
and sign those papers?

1119
01:08:59,787 --> 01:09:02,449
I was supposed to,
but I didn't have time.

1120
01:09:02,556 --> 01:09:05,525
I went to the police.

1121
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:12,889
You did?

1122
01:09:13,201 --> 01:09:15,101
Wow. What
did you tell them?

1123
01:09:15,203 --> 01:09:16,500
What did they say?

1124
01:09:16,604 --> 01:09:18,094
It was awful.

1125
01:09:19,407 --> 01:09:21,307
I felt really stupid.

1126
01:09:21,409 --> 01:09:24,708
They brought out a file
on this woman and-

1127
01:09:24,779 --> 01:09:26,713
At least
10 inches thick.

1128
01:09:27,849 --> 01:09:29,441
A ripoff artist, huh?

1129
01:09:29,551 --> 01:09:30,609
No, Molly.

1130
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:34,320
You know,
the sad thing...

1131
01:09:35,957 --> 01:09:37,891
is that
I believed her.

1132
01:09:37,992 --> 01:09:39,459
Molly...

1133
01:09:41,529 --> 01:09:43,588
sometimes
we need to believe.

1134
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:46,531
Why? What's the point?

1135
01:09:46,601 --> 01:09:48,001
Molly, it's not easy to face
the realities of life sometimes.

1136
01:09:50,439 --> 01:09:52,498
You got to
give yourself that.

1137
01:09:52,641 --> 01:09:57,340
What you've got to remember
is the love that you guys felt.

1138
01:09:57,446 --> 01:09:59,778
You got to remember
how good Sam was.

1139
01:09:59,849 --> 01:10:02,340
You were everything
to him, Molly.

1140
01:10:02,451 --> 01:10:03,782
You were his life.

1141
01:10:18,567 --> 01:10:19,898
I feel so alone.

1142
01:10:28,612 --> 01:10:29,943
You're not alone.

1143
01:10:30,046 --> 01:10:30,944
OK?

1144
01:10:32,315 --> 01:10:34,715
You got your work.
You're incredibly talented.

1145
01:10:34,818 --> 01:10:35,750
You're young.

1146
01:10:35,852 --> 01:10:38,047
You're fantastically
gorgeous.

1147
01:10:39,756 --> 01:10:42,088
I don't know
what's real anymore.

1148
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,828
I don't know
what to think.

1149
01:10:49,065 --> 01:10:50,760
Just think about Sam.

1150
01:10:53,436 --> 01:10:56,303
Think about the time
you guys had together.

1151
01:10:57,541 --> 01:10:59,373
How wonderful that was.

1152
01:11:00,611 --> 01:11:01,737
Yeah.

1153
01:11:02,947 --> 01:11:05,882
Let your feelings out,
Moll. It's OK.

1154
01:11:06,017 --> 01:11:08,451
Life turns on a dime.

1155
01:11:09,954 --> 01:11:10,943
You know?

1156
01:11:12,657 --> 01:11:13,646
I mean...

1157
01:11:14,792 --> 01:11:16,350
people think that...

1158
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:19,486
they're there forever, that there's
always going to be tomorrow,

1159
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:20,927
but that's bullshit.

1160
01:11:21,065 --> 01:11:22,999
Sam taught us that.

1161
01:11:24,502 --> 01:11:26,834
You have to
live for now.

1162
01:11:29,473 --> 01:11:30,599
For today.

1163
01:11:50,696 --> 01:11:51,594
I can't.

1164
01:11:51,697 --> 01:11:52,595
I'm sorry.

1165
01:11:52,698 --> 01:11:53,596
It's OK.

1166
01:11:53,732 --> 01:11:56,394
I-I-I can't.
It's just too soon.

1167
01:11:56,501 --> 01:11:57,433
It's OK.

1168
01:11:57,502 --> 01:11:59,402
You've been great,
Carl.

1169
01:12:02,441 --> 01:12:04,375
But I need you
to leave.

1170
01:12:04,443 --> 01:12:05,740
I understand totally.

1171
01:12:05,878 --> 01:12:06,776
Please.

1172
01:12:12,485 --> 01:12:15,682
Could we just have dinner
tomorrow night? Just talk?

1173
01:12:15,788 --> 01:12:18,120
Can I interest you
in that?

1174
01:12:19,492 --> 01:12:20,516
Yeah.

1175
01:12:20,627 --> 01:12:21,525
Sure.

1176
01:12:21,628 --> 01:12:22,526
Great.

1177
01:13:30,832 --> 01:13:31,730
Hey.

1178
01:13:36,471 --> 01:13:38,803
Get off my train!

1179
01:13:38,907 --> 01:13:39,805
No.

1180
01:13:39,908 --> 01:13:42,767
Get off!

1181
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:45,042
Get off!

1182
01:13:45,146 --> 01:13:46,511
Get off!

1183
01:13:46,614 --> 01:13:47,740
Get out of here!

1184
01:13:47,882 --> 01:13:48,871
Get off!

1185
01:13:49,017 --> 01:13:49,915
No.

1186
01:13:50,018 --> 01:13:51,918
Show me
how you do that.

1187
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:54,250
I'm not leaving
till you teach me.

1188
01:13:54,522 --> 01:13:55,489
Get off!

1189
01:13:55,623 --> 01:13:56,647
No.

1190
01:13:56,759 --> 01:13:57,657
Get off!

1191
01:14:04,734 --> 01:14:07,168
You stubborn asshole.

1192
01:14:07,269 --> 01:14:08,759
Ha ha ha.

1193
01:14:08,871 --> 01:14:10,202
What are you doing?

1194
01:14:10,272 --> 01:14:12,206
What the hell
are you doing?

1195
01:14:12,274 --> 01:14:13,764
What am I doing?

1196
01:14:13,876 --> 01:14:16,208
You're trying to move it
with your finger.

1197
01:14:16,278 --> 01:14:18,610
You can't push it.
You're dead.

1198
01:14:27,123 --> 01:14:29,057
It's all in your mind.

1199
01:14:29,125 --> 01:14:32,618
The problem with you
is you still think you're real.

1200
01:14:32,729 --> 01:14:34,629
You think you're
wearing those clothes?

1201
01:14:34,731 --> 01:14:36,961
You think you're crouched
on that floor?

1202
01:14:37,067 --> 01:14:37,965
Bullshit!

1203
01:14:38,068 --> 01:14:40,559
You ain't got a body
no more, son!

1204
01:14:40,670 --> 01:14:42,001
It's all up here!

1205
01:14:42,105 --> 01:14:43,595
You want
to move something,

1206
01:14:43,673 --> 01:14:46,005
you got to move it
with your mind!

1207
01:14:46,109 --> 01:14:47,599
You got to focus!

1208
01:14:47,677 --> 01:14:49,611
How? How do you focus?

1209
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:52,079
I don't know
how you focus.

1210
01:14:52,215 --> 01:14:53,705
You just focus.

1211
01:14:57,020 --> 01:14:58,783
How did you do that?

1212
01:14:58,855 --> 01:15:01,085
You got to take
all your emotions,

1213
01:15:01,158 --> 01:15:03,888
all your anger, all your love,
all your hate,

1214
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:05,291
and push it way down

1215
01:15:05,562 --> 01:15:07,154
into the pit
of your stomach

1216
01:15:07,264 --> 01:15:09,756
and let it explode
like a reactor. Pow!

1217
01:15:12,003 --> 01:15:12,935
OK.

1218
01:15:13,037 --> 01:15:13,935
OK.

1219
01:15:18,943 --> 01:15:20,535
Don't laugh.

1220
01:15:45,270 --> 01:15:46,828
Way to go, kid.

1221
01:15:46,972 --> 01:15:48,303
I did it.

1222
01:15:50,075 --> 01:15:51,599
I did it.

1223
01:15:51,743 --> 01:15:53,040
Way to go.

1224
01:16:00,052 --> 01:16:02,919
From your gut,
like I told you.

1225
01:16:05,891 --> 01:16:08,826
Give it time.
What else have you got?

1226
01:16:16,335 --> 01:16:18,826
How long
have you been here?

1227
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:23,167
Since they pushed me.

1228
01:16:23,309 --> 01:16:24,799
Someone pushed you?

1229
01:16:24,911 --> 01:16:26,139
Yeah, someone pushed me.

1230
01:16:26,246 --> 01:16:27,645
Who?

1231
01:16:27,747 --> 01:16:29,044
You don't believe me?

1232
01:16:29,149 --> 01:16:32,016
You think I fell?
You think I jumped?

1233
01:16:32,118 --> 01:16:33,585
Well, fuck you!

1234
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:35,210
It wasn't my time!

1235
01:16:35,355 --> 01:16:37,255
I wasn't supposed to go!

1236
01:16:37,357 --> 01:16:39,825
I'm not supposed
to be here!

1237
01:16:48,968 --> 01:16:53,098
Oh, I'd give anything
for a drag.

1238
01:16:53,239 --> 01:16:55,401
Just one drag.

1239
01:16:55,709 --> 01:16:57,267
Are you all right?

1240
01:16:57,411 --> 01:17:00,039
Who are you?
Why are you hounding me?

1241
01:17:00,147 --> 01:17:02,115
Who sent you?

1242
01:17:04,185 --> 01:17:05,982
Who sent you?

1243
01:17:08,155 --> 01:17:09,679
Leave me alone.

1244
01:17:09,823 --> 01:17:11,154
Leave me alone!

1245
01:17:11,258 --> 01:17:13,385
Leave me alone!

1246
01:17:56,972 --> 01:17:57,939
Yes!

1247
01:18:13,322 --> 01:18:14,789
You need
to concentrate,

1248
01:18:14,890 --> 01:18:16,221
'cause if
you concentrate,

1249
01:18:16,325 --> 01:18:17,792
you'll probably
rouse him.

1250
01:18:17,893 --> 01:18:19,224
What's his name
again?

1251
01:18:19,328 --> 01:18:20,226
Orlando.

1252
01:18:20,329 --> 01:18:21,296
Orlando.

1253
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:24,263
Orlando. Orlando.
Is there an Orlando here?

1254
01:18:24,367 --> 01:18:25,265
I'm here.

1255
01:18:25,368 --> 01:18:26,266
He's here.

1256
01:18:26,369 --> 01:18:27,700
Oda Mae, I-

1257
01:18:27,803 --> 01:18:28,701
Sam.

1258
01:18:28,804 --> 01:18:30,135
Excuse me.
I'm Orlando.

1259
01:18:30,206 --> 01:18:31,696
The line's
over there.

1260
01:18:31,807 --> 01:18:33,707
Where did these ghosts
come from?

1261
01:18:33,809 --> 01:18:35,174
You can hear them, too?

1262
01:18:35,244 --> 01:18:38,179
I hear them in the morning
and the evening.

1263
01:18:38,247 --> 01:18:39,874
They're coming
into the shower.

1264
01:18:40,016 --> 01:18:42,986
Did you tell every spook
you met about me?

1265
01:18:43,086 --> 01:18:45,782
I got spooks from Jersey
coming in here.

1266
01:18:45,922 --> 01:18:48,482
There's stuff going on
you wouldn't believe.

1267
01:18:48,592 --> 01:18:50,526
It's amazing.
You're really doing it.

1268
01:18:50,794 --> 01:18:51,556
I know.

1269
01:18:51,795 --> 01:18:53,456
Can you
hurry this up?

1270
01:18:53,563 --> 01:18:55,793
Oh, chill out.
Chill out.

1271
01:18:55,899 --> 01:18:57,230
I need your help.

1272
01:18:57,301 --> 01:18:59,235
There's something
we need to do.

1273
01:18:59,336 --> 01:19:01,702
I'm not doing anything
else with you, Sam.

1274
01:19:01,805 --> 01:19:03,705
You're holding on
to a life

1275
01:19:03,807 --> 01:19:05,172
that doesn't
want you anymore.

1276
01:19:05,275 --> 01:19:07,436
It doesn't want you.
Give up the ghost.

1277
01:19:07,544 --> 01:19:09,478
Are you speaking
to me?

1278
01:19:09,546 --> 01:19:11,480
Does it look like it?

1279
01:19:11,548 --> 01:19:14,176
You're supposed to be
concentrating, aren't you?

1280
01:19:14,318 --> 01:19:15,808
You going to try it?

1281
01:19:15,886 --> 01:19:17,080
Thank you very much.

1282
01:19:17,187 --> 01:19:19,520
Sam, are you going
to get out of here?

1283
01:19:20,792 --> 01:19:22,123
Fine, then stay there.

1284
01:19:22,226 --> 01:19:23,124
Excuse me.

1285
01:19:23,227 --> 01:19:24,125
Excuse me.

1286
01:19:24,228 --> 01:19:25,490
You ready now?

1287
01:19:25,596 --> 01:19:27,029
Let's do it.

1288
01:19:27,165 --> 01:19:29,497
I got to talk
to you now.

1289
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:31,067
I've got a plan.

1290
01:19:31,169 --> 01:19:34,798
All we got to do
is we can...

1291
01:19:34,906 --> 01:19:36,032
Oda Mae?

1292
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:44,242
Oda Mae.

1293
01:19:46,951 --> 01:19:47,918
Ortisha?

1294
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:51,288
Orlando. Is that you?

1295
01:19:51,356 --> 01:19:54,326
Ortisha, where you at?
I can't hardly see.

1296
01:19:54,426 --> 01:19:55,290
Here.
Sh-She's here.

1297
01:19:55,394 --> 01:19:58,830
In front of you.
I'm right here.

1298
01:20:02,368 --> 01:20:05,633
Damn, baby, what did
you do to your hair?

1299
01:20:07,873 --> 01:20:09,306
Orlando, you like it?

1300
01:20:09,408 --> 01:20:11,933
It's autumn sunrise.

1301
01:20:14,446 --> 01:20:17,938
Get out of me,
you son of a bitch.

1302
01:20:21,053 --> 01:20:23,647
Don't you ever do that
to me again.

1303
01:20:23,889 --> 01:20:25,015
Orlando?

1304
01:20:25,157 --> 01:20:26,488
Ugh!

1305
01:20:26,592 --> 01:20:29,060
I can barely move.

1306
01:20:29,194 --> 01:20:30,992
You should know
better than that.

1307
01:20:31,097 --> 01:20:33,122
Jumping into bodies
wipes you out.

1308
01:20:33,266 --> 01:20:34,164
Everybody out.

1309
01:20:34,267 --> 01:20:35,564
What happened
to Orlando?

1310
01:20:35,668 --> 01:20:38,193
Where's
the insurance policy?

1311
01:20:38,304 --> 01:20:39,635
Are you deaf?

1312
01:20:39,739 --> 01:20:42,105
I said everybody out!

1313
01:20:42,208 --> 01:20:43,368
Everybody out!

1314
01:20:43,476 --> 01:20:44,966
Get out! Get out!

1315
01:20:45,078 --> 01:20:46,409
Everybody get out!

1316
01:20:58,324 --> 01:20:59,985
Get out.

1317
01:21:00,093 --> 01:21:01,355
You the fortune-teller?

1318
01:21:01,494 --> 01:21:02,961
Who are you?

1319
01:21:03,096 --> 01:21:04,393
That's an interesting
question.

1320
01:21:05,599 --> 01:21:07,260
Why don't you tell me?

1321
01:21:07,368 --> 01:21:08,392
Willy.

1322
01:21:08,502 --> 01:21:09,901
Willy?

1323
01:21:10,004 --> 01:21:11,596
Prospect Place Willy?

1324
01:21:11,705 --> 01:21:13,605
Get out of here fast.

1325
01:21:25,486 --> 01:21:27,647
Oda Mae!
Sister! Sister!

1326
01:21:29,390 --> 01:21:31,722
I'm all right.
I'm all right.

1327
01:21:34,128 --> 01:21:36,494
We're in trouble,
so you got to help.

1328
01:21:36,597 --> 01:21:39,498
What do you mean we?
You're already dead.

1329
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:42,001
These people
are trying to kill me.

1330
01:21:42,103 --> 01:21:43,434
And they'll be back.

1331
01:21:43,505 --> 01:21:46,440
Why don't you just find
a house to haunt?

1332
01:21:46,508 --> 01:21:48,999
Get some chains and
rattle them or something.

1333
01:21:49,110 --> 01:21:51,271
I have a plan,
and it will work,

1334
01:21:51,379 --> 01:21:53,210
but get some
of your fake I.D.S.

1335
01:21:53,315 --> 01:21:54,509
Forget it.

1336
01:21:54,649 --> 01:21:58,085
If you do this, they'll
never bother you again.

1337
01:22:03,091 --> 01:22:04,183
Scout's honor.

1338
01:22:05,527 --> 01:22:07,017
All right.

1339
01:22:07,162 --> 01:22:08,720
What do I have to do?

1340
01:22:08,997 --> 01:22:10,931
What exactly
do I have to do?

1341
01:22:12,667 --> 01:22:14,601
You got a nice dress?

1342
01:22:17,073 --> 01:22:20,270
I don't see what's wrong
with what I'm wearing.

1343
01:22:20,343 --> 01:22:23,676
Sorry. I made a joke.
I love your shoes.

1344
01:22:23,779 --> 01:22:26,270
I don't know anything
about banking.

1345
01:22:26,349 --> 01:22:28,681
Oda Mae, would
you just relax?

1346
01:22:28,818 --> 01:22:30,308
Listen, I'm nervous.

1347
01:22:30,386 --> 01:22:32,320
I'll get you
through it.

1348
01:22:32,388 --> 01:22:34,754
Your fake driver's
license is great.

1349
01:22:35,024 --> 01:22:38,323
Oh, Sam. I don't think
I should do this.

1350
01:22:38,461 --> 01:22:41,396
Straight ahead.
A stairway that says new accounts.

1351
01:22:41,497 --> 01:22:43,397
I ain't giving
them money.

1352
01:22:43,499 --> 01:22:45,433
Do what I say.
Don't talk.

1353
01:22:46,502 --> 01:22:47,833
Tell her you're here

1354
01:22:48,070 --> 01:22:51,403
to fill out a signature
card for a new account.

1355
01:22:51,507 --> 01:22:55,774
I'm here to fill out
a signature card for a new account.

1356
01:22:55,879 --> 01:22:57,779
Do you know
your account number?

1357
01:22:57,881 --> 01:22:59,439
926-31043.

1358
01:22:59,550 --> 01:23:00,312
926...

1359
01:23:00,417 --> 01:23:01,315
31043.

1360
01:23:01,451 --> 01:23:03,146
31043.

1361
01:23:04,788 --> 01:23:05,686
Rita Miller.

1362
01:23:05,789 --> 01:23:06,687
Who?

1363
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:07,688
Rita Miller.

1364
01:23:07,791 --> 01:23:08,723
Rita Miller.

1365
01:23:08,825 --> 01:23:10,315
Didn't you sign a card

1366
01:23:10,394 --> 01:23:11,691
when you opened
the account?

1367
01:23:11,828 --> 01:23:14,319
Carl Bruner opened it
for you by phone

1368
01:23:14,431 --> 01:23:16,331
and asked you
to come in today.

1369
01:23:16,433 --> 01:23:19,197
Carl Bruner opened it
for me by phone.

1370
01:23:19,269 --> 01:23:21,396
Now he's asked me
to come in today.

1371
01:23:22,706 --> 01:23:24,037
Is that right?

1372
01:23:24,141 --> 01:23:25,608
Yeah.

1373
01:23:25,709 --> 01:23:31,546
All right. Just sign this
card on the bottom line, please.

1374
01:23:31,649 --> 01:23:34,550
May I use your pen?
Thank you so much.

1375
01:23:39,891 --> 01:23:41,791
No, no, no!
Rita Miller.

1376
01:23:41,893 --> 01:23:44,225
I'm so sorry.

1377
01:23:44,295 --> 01:23:45,660
You know, I...

1378
01:23:45,763 --> 01:23:48,596
I need another one.
I signed the wrong name.

1379
01:23:53,538 --> 01:23:56,803
Make sure it goes up to
the third floor file

1380
01:23:56,908 --> 01:23:59,399
because you have
a transaction to make.

1381
01:23:59,510 --> 01:24:02,274
Make sure this goes
to the third floor file.

1382
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:04,747
I have a transfusion
to make.

1383
01:24:04,817 --> 01:24:05,715
A what?

1384
01:24:05,818 --> 01:24:07,342
Let's go.

1385
01:24:07,453 --> 01:24:10,718
You know what I mean.
Can I keep this pen?

1386
01:24:10,823 --> 01:24:12,791
Uh... uh,
yes, sure.

1387
01:24:13,092 --> 01:24:14,616
Thank you so much.

1388
01:24:15,728 --> 01:24:18,629
Bye-bye. I just
love these pens.

1389
01:24:18,731 --> 01:24:22,223
What do you want to
keep the pen for?

1390
01:24:23,369 --> 01:24:24,700
Carl Bruner speaking.

1391
01:24:24,803 --> 01:24:26,270
Hi, Carl.

1392
01:24:26,372 --> 01:24:27,270
Mr. Balistrari.

1393
01:24:27,373 --> 01:24:30,308
Balistrari? Carl,
it's me, John.

1394
01:24:30,376 --> 01:24:34,710
John. John, sorry, um,
what-what- what-what's up?

1395
01:24:34,813 --> 01:24:37,304
I've got the info
on the Bradley portfolio.

1396
01:24:37,383 --> 01:24:38,281
Oh, right.

1397
01:24:38,384 --> 01:24:40,717
I'll pick it up
later, all right?

1398
01:24:40,820 --> 01:24:42,515
I'll be here
till 6:00.

1399
01:24:47,527 --> 01:24:51,327
I don't suppose I can
talk you into losing the hat.

1400
01:24:51,431 --> 01:24:52,762
You keep
messing with me,

1401
01:24:52,899 --> 01:24:54,332
you'll be here
by yourself.

1402
01:24:54,467 --> 01:24:59,773
Shh. Now tell the guard
you're here to see Lyle Ferguson.

1403
01:24:59,808 --> 01:25:02,606
Hi. I'm here to see
Lyle Ferguson, please.

1404
01:25:02,709 --> 01:25:04,643
Do you have
an appointment?

1405
01:25:04,711 --> 01:25:06,645
No, I'm here
for my health.

1406
01:25:06,713 --> 01:25:08,647
Tell him Rita
Miller's here.

1407
01:25:08,715 --> 01:25:11,206
You-You just tell him
Rita Miller's here.

1408
01:25:11,317 --> 01:25:12,215
One moment.

1409
01:25:12,318 --> 01:25:13,216
Don't embellish.

1410
01:25:13,319 --> 01:25:14,752
Jawohl.

1411
01:25:14,854 --> 01:25:16,288
Excuse me?

1412
01:25:19,927 --> 01:25:22,418
Now, listen.
This guy Ferguson's a real jerk.

1413
01:25:22,530 --> 01:25:24,430
I've known him
for five years,

1414
01:25:24,532 --> 01:25:26,432
and he still
thinks my name's-

1415
01:25:26,567 --> 01:25:27,829
Why are you
whispering?

1416
01:25:27,968 --> 01:25:30,129
Just be quiet
and listen.

1417
01:25:30,271 --> 01:25:31,602
He's a social moron.

1418
01:25:31,706 --> 01:25:34,402
Just tell the guard
Ferguson knows you.

1419
01:25:34,508 --> 01:25:37,409
You spent time with him
and his wife Shirley

1420
01:25:37,511 --> 01:25:40,412
at the Brewsters' Christmas
party last year. Got it?

1421
01:25:40,514 --> 01:25:42,539
What is this
in regards to?

1422
01:25:42,650 --> 01:25:44,550
What? He doesn't
remember me?

1423
01:25:44,652 --> 01:25:46,552
Oh, we spent
all that time

1424
01:25:46,654 --> 01:25:49,885
at the Brewsters' Christmas
party last year.

1425
01:25:50,024 --> 01:25:51,515
It was beautiful.

1426
01:25:51,593 --> 01:25:54,562
A big old tree and thousands
of presents everywhere.

1427
01:25:54,629 --> 01:25:55,561
It-

1428
01:25:57,499 --> 01:25:58,864
Gas.

1429
01:25:59,968 --> 01:26:02,835
I get a little gas
from time to time.

1430
01:26:02,904 --> 01:26:04,371
That's all. Gas.

1431
01:26:05,507 --> 01:26:06,804
Quit poking me!

1432
01:26:06,908 --> 01:26:08,341
Well,
don't overdo it.

1433
01:26:08,477 --> 01:26:10,377
Now, listen.
This'll be easy.

1434
01:26:10,479 --> 01:26:13,573
Ferguson was so drunk,
he could've had a conversation

1435
01:26:13,682 --> 01:26:15,912
with Tina Turner
and not remember.

1436
01:26:20,288 --> 01:26:21,949
I don't know, Sam.

1437
01:26:22,257 --> 01:26:23,554
Here we go.

1438
01:26:26,928 --> 01:26:27,861
Hello. Hello.

1439
01:26:27,930 --> 01:26:29,295
Uh, yes.

1440
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:32,390
Of course, yes.

1441
01:26:32,502 --> 01:26:34,970
Well, uh, it's been
a... a long time.

1442
01:26:35,271 --> 01:26:36,136
Long time.

1443
01:26:36,272 --> 01:26:38,604
Ask how Bobby
and Snooky are doing.

1444
01:26:38,674 --> 01:26:40,608
How are Bobby
and Snooky doing?

1445
01:26:40,676 --> 01:26:43,236
Fine. Fine.
Thank you.

1446
01:26:43,346 --> 01:26:44,677
Thank you
for asking.

1447
01:26:44,781 --> 01:26:49,616
Uh, and how is
your, uh, family?

1448
01:26:49,719 --> 01:26:51,812
Oh, couldn't
be better.

1449
01:26:51,921 --> 01:26:53,479
Well... wonderful.

1450
01:26:53,589 --> 01:26:55,489
Tell him you've
been wondering

1451
01:26:55,591 --> 01:26:57,957
how they did on the
Gibraltar securities.

1452
01:26:58,027 --> 01:26:59,517
I was just wondering,

1453
01:26:59,629 --> 01:27:02,393
how did you do on
the Gibraltar securities?

1454
01:27:02,498 --> 01:27:03,761
The Gibraltar
securities?

1455
01:27:03,867 --> 01:27:07,735
Well, it looks like we topped out
on that one, huh?

1456
01:27:07,805 --> 01:27:09,738
Sure did.

1457
01:27:09,807 --> 01:27:11,604
That was
a useful tip.

1458
01:27:11,675 --> 01:27:12,835
Good old Randy.

1459
01:27:12,943 --> 01:27:15,810
Good old Randy. Got a
good old head on his shoulders.

1460
01:27:15,913 --> 01:27:17,039
Her shoulders.

1461
01:27:17,314 --> 01:27:18,645
Her shoulders.

1462
01:27:18,749 --> 01:27:19,738
Randy.

1463
01:27:19,817 --> 01:27:22,285
So, what...

1464
01:27:22,386 --> 01:27:23,819
what brings you
here today?

1465
01:27:23,921 --> 01:27:25,411
You're closing
an account.

1466
01:27:25,522 --> 01:27:26,853
I'm closing an account.

1467
01:27:26,957 --> 01:27:29,653
Do you have
your account number?

1468
01:27:29,793 --> 01:27:30,657
Yes?

1469
01:27:30,794 --> 01:27:31,692
Yes.

1470
01:27:31,795 --> 01:27:32,693
Yes.

1471
01:27:32,796 --> 01:27:33,694
926-31043.

1472
01:27:33,797 --> 01:27:36,561
926-31043.
Is that right?

1473
01:27:36,667 --> 01:27:37,565
Yeah.

1474
01:27:37,668 --> 01:27:38,863
Good.

1475
01:27:47,011 --> 01:27:50,503
Well, Rita, it looks like
you'll be withdrawing

1476
01:27:50,582 --> 01:27:52,777
$4 million
from us today.

1477
01:27:52,884 --> 01:27:54,351
$4 million!

1478
01:27:54,452 --> 01:27:56,352
Say yes. Say yes!

1479
01:27:56,421 --> 01:27:57,353
Is that correct?

1480
01:27:57,422 --> 01:27:58,354
Yes.

1481
01:27:58,423 --> 01:28:00,687
Yes.
Yes, uh, yes!

1482
01:28:00,792 --> 01:28:02,589
Yes, that's correct.

1483
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:04,286
Easy, easy.

1484
01:28:04,429 --> 01:28:09,526
Yes. Well, how
would you like that?

1485
01:28:09,634 --> 01:28:11,602
1 Os and 20s.

1486
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:12,635
Pardon?

1487
01:28:12,737 --> 01:28:14,330
Tell him
a cashier's check.

1488
01:28:14,473 --> 01:28:16,805
I think better
a cashier's check.

1489
01:28:16,909 --> 01:28:18,706
A cashier's check.
Fine.

1490
01:28:18,811 --> 01:28:20,711
Well, of course,
uh, you know,

1491
01:28:20,813 --> 01:28:22,713
we require identification
from everyone.

1492
01:28:22,815 --> 01:28:24,305
Oh, I see.

1493
01:28:24,416 --> 01:28:25,713
It's just
procedural.

1494
01:28:25,818 --> 01:28:27,513
Yes. I...

1495
01:28:37,396 --> 01:28:38,124
Thank you.

1496
01:28:38,397 --> 01:28:40,865
Well, I'll, uh,
I'll be right back.

1497
01:28:42,668 --> 01:28:43,965
$4 million!

1498
01:28:44,069 --> 01:28:44,967
Shh!

1499
01:28:49,608 --> 01:28:52,942
Yeah, get me the
First Island Bank of Nassau.

1500
01:28:53,013 --> 01:28:54,446
It's on the Rolodex.

1501
01:29:03,857 --> 01:29:08,351
Well, we have some, uh,
things for you to sign here.

1502
01:29:08,428 --> 01:29:11,397
This officially
closes the account.

1503
01:29:11,464 --> 01:29:13,398
And, uh,
here you are.

1504
01:29:13,466 --> 01:29:14,797
Now sign Rita Miller.

1505
01:29:17,470 --> 01:29:20,906
Rita Miller.
That's my name.

1506
01:29:21,041 --> 01:29:24,875
My name. Rita Miller.
My name.

1507
01:29:24,978 --> 01:29:27,379
That's my name.

1508
01:29:27,481 --> 01:29:28,379
Molly, hi.

1509
01:29:28,482 --> 01:29:29,380
Hi.

1510
01:29:29,483 --> 01:29:32,611
Oda Mae,
I'll be right back.

1511
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:33,982
Just anywhere?

1512
01:29:34,088 --> 01:29:34,986
Right here.

1513
01:29:35,089 --> 01:29:35,987
Right.

1514
01:29:40,962 --> 01:29:42,054
Fine.

1515
01:29:42,163 --> 01:29:44,597
The, uh, check.

1516
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,900
This, uh-

1517
01:29:48,002 --> 01:29:49,765
Here you are.

1518
01:29:49,837 --> 01:29:53,773
The person you need
is right down on the end.

1519
01:29:56,978 --> 01:30:00,880
Mama took the money that
she made in the oil wells,

1520
01:30:00,982 --> 01:30:03,474
and she sunk it
into gas pumps.

1521
01:30:03,552 --> 01:30:05,247
You know, how they have
at the gas station?

1522
01:30:06,989 --> 01:30:08,479
It's very,
very lucrative.

1523
01:30:08,557 --> 01:30:09,489
Oda Mae...

1524
01:30:09,558 --> 01:30:10,889
it really adds up.

1525
01:30:10,993 --> 01:30:12,551
Say goodbye.

1526
01:30:12,661 --> 01:30:14,993
It's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

1527
01:30:15,097 --> 01:30:17,793
Now, may I keep the pen?

1528
01:30:17,899 --> 01:30:20,925
Say good night to Bobby
and Snooky for me.

1529
01:30:21,069 --> 01:30:21,967
Bye-bye.

1530
01:30:22,070 --> 01:30:23,970
Why are you
rushing me?

1531
01:30:28,343 --> 01:30:30,174
What is wrong?

1532
01:30:39,655 --> 01:30:40,986
Excuse me. Lyle?

1533
01:30:41,090 --> 01:30:42,557
Oh, yes.

1534
01:30:42,625 --> 01:30:45,218
Molly.

1535
01:30:45,294 --> 01:30:47,558
Jensen. The woman you were
just doing business with...

1536
01:30:47,663 --> 01:30:48,595
Yeah?

1537
01:30:48,664 --> 01:30:49,995
What did she want?

1538
01:30:50,133 --> 01:30:52,601
Did it have anything
to do with Sam?

1539
01:30:52,702 --> 01:30:54,932
Sam? Why, no. No.

1540
01:30:55,004 --> 01:30:57,336
That was Oda Mae Brown,
right?

1541
01:30:57,607 --> 01:30:59,336
No. Her name
was Rita Miller.

1542
01:30:59,642 --> 01:31:01,132
She was closing
an account.

1543
01:31:01,277 --> 01:31:02,642
Is there a problem?

1544
01:31:03,980 --> 01:31:07,472
No, I guess not.
Thank you.

1545
01:31:37,014 --> 01:31:39,539
Carl,
is something wrong?

1546
01:31:39,683 --> 01:31:41,981
Is somebody playing
with the computers?

1547
01:31:42,086 --> 01:31:42,984
What?

1548
01:31:43,087 --> 01:31:44,987
One of my accounts
is closed.

1549
01:31:45,089 --> 01:31:46,579
Which account?
What's wrong?

1550
01:31:46,690 --> 01:31:48,989
You want me
to call someone?

1551
01:31:49,094 --> 01:31:50,584
No, it's OK.

1552
01:31:50,695 --> 01:31:52,663
I can do it.
I got it.

1553
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:57,197
$4 million!

1554
01:31:57,335 --> 01:32:00,304
What am I going to
do with this money?

1555
01:32:00,605 --> 01:32:02,334
I'm going
to buy the block.

1556
01:32:02,607 --> 01:32:06,338
I'm going to make my sister
go to a fat farm.

1557
01:32:06,644 --> 01:32:08,976
I'm going to
buy the building.

1558
01:32:09,047 --> 01:32:10,378
I've got an idea.

1559
01:32:10,648 --> 01:32:11,376
Please donate.

1560
01:32:11,649 --> 01:32:14,243
Take the check
out of your purse.

1561
01:32:14,385 --> 01:32:17,821
Right. I should put it
where nobody can get it.

1562
01:32:17,922 --> 01:32:19,253
No. No. Endorse it.

1563
01:32:19,357 --> 01:32:22,258
If I endorse it,
then if I drop it,

1564
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:23,850
somebody will get it.

1565
01:32:23,928 --> 01:32:26,921
I never said you were
going to get the money.

1566
01:32:27,032 --> 01:32:29,830
It's blood money.
I was killed for this money.

1567
01:32:29,969 --> 01:32:31,300
Now,
endorse the check.

1568
01:32:31,403 --> 01:32:33,963
What are you going
to do with it?

1569
01:32:35,674 --> 01:32:37,039
Look over there.

1570
01:32:37,109 --> 01:32:39,703
To your left.

1571
01:32:41,981 --> 01:32:45,212
You don't think
I'm giving this $4 million

1572
01:32:45,284 --> 01:32:47,218
to a bunch of nuns.

1573
01:32:47,286 --> 01:32:49,754
If you don't,
they'll track you down.

1574
01:32:49,889 --> 01:32:51,220
Get rid of it.

1575
01:32:51,290 --> 01:32:52,882
Sam,
you're killing me!

1576
01:32:52,992 --> 01:32:54,323
It's $4 million!

1577
01:32:54,426 --> 01:32:55,859
You'll go to heaven.

1578
01:32:55,961 --> 01:32:58,259
I don't want
to go to heaven.

1579
01:32:58,364 --> 01:33:00,663
I want to
cash the check.

1580
01:33:03,803 --> 01:33:04,667
Hello.

1581
01:33:04,804 --> 01:33:06,135
You'll thank me
later.

1582
01:33:06,239 --> 01:33:07,797
How are you
doing?

1583
01:33:09,442 --> 01:33:11,376
Now, endorse it
"Rita Miller."

1584
01:33:11,645 --> 01:33:12,373
I know.

1585
01:33:12,646 --> 01:33:15,376
Make it out
to St. Joseph's shelter.

1586
01:33:15,682 --> 01:33:18,412
I can't believe
you're making me do this.

1587
01:33:23,490 --> 01:33:25,424
Now give it to her.

1588
01:33:25,492 --> 01:33:27,983
I want to feel it
one more time.

1589
01:33:28,094 --> 01:33:29,994
Give the lady
the check.

1590
01:33:30,096 --> 01:33:30,994
I will!

1591
01:33:32,499 --> 01:33:34,023
Hand her the check.

1592
01:33:34,134 --> 01:33:36,160
You can do it.

1593
01:33:38,139 --> 01:33:39,436
Give her the check.

1594
01:33:39,707 --> 01:33:41,470
I will!

1595
01:33:44,312 --> 01:33:47,281
Bless you, child.
Bless you.

1596
01:33:53,187 --> 01:33:54,984
Give it to her.

1597
01:33:55,056 --> 01:33:57,957
Let go. Let go!

1598
01:33:59,060 --> 01:33:59,924
Shit.

1599
01:34:03,998 --> 01:34:06,330
I'm proud of you,
Oda Mae.

1600
01:34:06,434 --> 01:34:09,926
I don't care. Stay away
from me from now on.

1601
01:34:10,004 --> 01:34:12,940
What is that nun going
to do with it?

1602
01:34:13,041 --> 01:34:15,942
Leave me alone.
Never talk to me again.

1603
01:34:16,044 --> 01:34:17,978
I think you're
wonderful, Oda Mae.

1604
01:34:53,583 --> 01:34:56,450
Go ahead, search.
You'll never find it.

1605
01:34:58,121 --> 01:35:00,316
They're going
to kill you, Carl.

1606
01:35:00,423 --> 01:35:01,890
You and Willy.

1607
01:35:02,025 --> 01:35:03,925
You're going
to be fertilizer.

1608
01:35:04,027 --> 01:35:07,929
They're going to bury you
right next to Jimmy Hoffa.

1609
01:35:09,232 --> 01:35:10,529
Yoo-hoo!

1610
01:35:51,575 --> 01:35:55,611
Who's doing that?

1611
01:36:10,462 --> 01:36:11,360
Hey.

1612
01:36:11,463 --> 01:36:12,361
Hi.

1613
01:36:12,464 --> 01:36:14,932
I thought we were
having dinner.

1614
01:36:15,033 --> 01:36:16,933
I know, Moll.
I'm sorry.

1615
01:36:17,035 --> 01:36:18,366
I just forgot.

1616
01:36:18,470 --> 01:36:20,370
Had trouble
at the bank.

1617
01:36:20,472 --> 01:36:22,372
Forgot?
I wish you'd called.

1618
01:36:22,474 --> 01:36:25,068
I've been
really worried.

1619
01:36:25,210 --> 01:36:27,940
Listen, Molly.
I got to ask you about something.

1620
01:36:28,079 --> 01:36:30,411
Yeah. He needs
to borrow $4 million.

1621
01:36:30,482 --> 01:36:33,417
When you said that you
thought Sam was here,

1622
01:36:33,518 --> 01:36:35,453
that he was
talking to you,

1623
01:36:35,521 --> 01:36:37,455
what did he
say to you?

1624
01:36:37,523 --> 01:36:39,991
What does that have to do
with anything?

1625
01:36:40,126 --> 01:36:41,491
Just listen to me.

1626
01:36:41,594 --> 01:36:45,928
This psychic lady, I want
to know what she told you.

1627
01:36:46,031 --> 01:36:46,929
Stop this.

1628
01:36:49,135 --> 01:36:52,468
It doesn't matter.
It wasn't real.

1629
01:36:52,538 --> 01:36:55,029
What the hell happened
to you tonight?

1630
01:36:55,141 --> 01:36:57,041
Does this have
anything to do

1631
01:36:57,176 --> 01:37:00,077
with her being
at the bank today?

1632
01:37:02,948 --> 01:37:04,279
The bank?

1633
01:37:04,383 --> 01:37:08,149
Yeah. Ferguson said
she closed an account.

1634
01:37:08,287 --> 01:37:11,189
Her name isn't even
Oda Mae Brown.

1635
01:37:11,291 --> 01:37:13,191
It's Rita Miller
or something.

1636
01:37:16,296 --> 01:37:18,560
Carl, are you all right?

1637
01:37:21,101 --> 01:37:23,126
It's just
my stomach. It's...

1638
01:37:25,038 --> 01:37:26,630
Jesus.

1639
01:37:26,706 --> 01:37:30,642
Do you have any, like, some
Pepto-Bismol or something?

1640
01:37:30,911 --> 01:37:31,639
Cyanide...

1641
01:37:31,912 --> 01:37:33,243
Uh, yeah.
It's upstairs.

1642
01:37:33,346 --> 01:37:35,280
Sit down.
I'll get it.

1643
01:37:41,555 --> 01:37:42,453
What's wrong?

1644
01:37:42,556 --> 01:37:45,389
Does little Carl
have a tummy ache?

1645
01:37:45,492 --> 01:37:46,960
What are you doing?

1646
01:37:51,999 --> 01:37:54,331
Now do you
believe in ghosts?

1647
01:37:57,138 --> 01:37:59,231
I'll set the place
on fire,

1648
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:00,534
I swear to God.

1649
01:38:08,049 --> 01:38:09,641
I'll cut her throat.

1650
01:38:09,717 --> 01:38:11,014
Carl.

1651
01:38:12,253 --> 01:38:15,552
I swear to God.
I'll cut her throat.

1652
01:38:18,526 --> 01:38:20,289
I need that money,

1653
01:38:20,394 --> 01:38:22,727
and I want it
tonight at 11:00.

1654
01:38:22,965 --> 01:38:25,297
If that psychic does
not bring it here,

1655
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:27,591
Molly is dead. OK?

1656
01:38:27,703 --> 01:38:30,194
Carl, who are
you talking to?

1657
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:32,433
Nothing. Now, Molly,
listen to me.

1658
01:38:32,541 --> 01:38:36,136
I can't explain this now,
but there's a problem, OK?

1659
01:38:36,245 --> 01:38:37,576
Something
at the bank.

1660
01:38:37,646 --> 01:38:39,136
Carl, you're
scaring me.

1661
01:38:39,281 --> 01:38:41,215
I'll come back
about 11:00.

1662
01:38:41,316 --> 01:38:42,647
Why? Why not now?

1663
01:38:42,751 --> 01:38:44,480
Molly, look,
I'll come back.

1664
01:38:44,586 --> 01:38:46,076
Like 11:00, OK?

1665
01:38:46,154 --> 01:38:48,486
I'm sorry to do
this to you, Molly,

1666
01:38:48,624 --> 01:38:50,524
but it's important.
Got to go.

1667
01:38:50,626 --> 01:38:51,718
Oda Mae!

1668
01:38:54,329 --> 01:38:55,296
Ahh!

1669
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:56,761
I'm Arsenio Hall.

1670
01:38:56,832 --> 01:38:59,324
Don't try to adjust
your television.

1671
01:38:59,435 --> 01:39:00,959
I'm black.

1672
01:39:01,070 --> 01:39:03,402
I want to watch
Love Connection.

1673
01:39:03,473 --> 01:39:04,963
I love
Love Connection.

1674
01:39:05,074 --> 01:39:06,974
I love that man
on there.

1675
01:39:07,076 --> 01:39:07,974
That's Arsenio.

1676
01:39:08,077 --> 01:39:08,975
So?

1677
01:39:09,078 --> 01:39:10,409
You love
Love Connection,

1678
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:12,380
send your picture
in there.

1679
01:39:12,482 --> 01:39:13,380
She did.

1680
01:39:13,483 --> 01:39:15,417
They just haven't
answered yet.

1681
01:39:15,485 --> 01:39:16,417
Oda Mae?

1682
01:39:16,486 --> 01:39:17,418
Sam?

1683
01:39:17,487 --> 01:39:19,114
Not again.

1684
01:39:19,255 --> 01:39:21,723
They want the check,
and they're coming for you.

1685
01:39:22,025 --> 01:39:25,324
The check you said they
would never know about?

1686
01:39:25,428 --> 01:39:26,759
Oda Mae,
what's happening?

1687
01:39:27,030 --> 01:39:28,019
Sam?

1688
01:39:28,164 --> 01:39:29,461
Get out of here!

1689
01:39:29,566 --> 01:39:30,464
Now! Go!

1690
01:39:30,567 --> 01:39:33,799
Put the damn remote down.
Come on.

1691
01:39:43,047 --> 01:39:45,447
Knock on the doors.

1692
01:39:45,583 --> 01:39:47,483
Help! Help!

1693
01:39:47,585 --> 01:39:49,485
It's an emergency.
Let us in.

1694
01:39:49,587 --> 01:39:51,077
Who are you
kidding?

1695
01:40:00,598 --> 01:40:01,496
Open up!

1696
01:40:01,599 --> 01:40:03,032
You can't come in.

1697
01:40:03,167 --> 01:40:04,691
The cat don't
like visitors.

1698
01:40:04,768 --> 01:40:07,259
She'll pee all over.

1699
01:40:15,614 --> 01:40:17,673
They're going
to get us.

1700
01:40:19,551 --> 01:40:20,711
Where's Sam?

1701
01:40:20,852 --> 01:40:22,513
The bitch just left.

1702
01:40:22,621 --> 01:40:24,111
I'll check
downstairs.

1703
01:40:36,167 --> 01:40:36,929
Carl?

1704
01:41:27,220 --> 01:41:28,346
Willy!

1705
01:41:37,264 --> 01:41:40,427
Hey, man. You got
a serious problem, man.

1706
01:42:02,523 --> 01:42:04,457
Help me!

1707
01:42:04,559 --> 01:42:05,617
Help!

1708
01:42:13,835 --> 01:42:15,894
Willy!

1709
01:42:41,296 --> 01:42:43,992
I heard the car.
I was standing right there.

1710
01:42:44,299 --> 01:42:46,767
You could hear it
across town.

1711
01:42:56,078 --> 01:42:57,670
Sure, they snuffed him.

1712
01:42:57,780 --> 01:42:59,645
Yeah, yeah.

1713
01:43:01,550 --> 01:43:03,609
That dude is dead.

1714
01:43:09,292 --> 01:43:10,987
You're dead, Willy.

1715
01:43:34,417 --> 01:43:38,911
No! No! No!

1716
01:43:41,090 --> 01:43:43,082
Help me!

1717
01:44:04,982 --> 01:44:06,882
Tell the driver
to hurry.

1718
01:44:06,984 --> 01:44:09,885
Yo, man, you want
to step on it, please?

1719
01:44:09,987 --> 01:44:12,922
Lady, I'm driving
as fast as I can.

1720
01:44:20,699 --> 01:44:21,791
Problems?

1721
01:44:29,641 --> 01:44:30,972
Carl, is that you?

1722
01:44:31,076 --> 01:44:33,536
No. It's me, Oda Mae.
Listen.

1723
01:44:33,645 --> 01:44:35,977
Molly, I know what you
think of me,

1724
01:44:36,081 --> 01:44:38,447
but you are in
serious danger.

1725
01:44:38,550 --> 01:44:40,882
I got Sam here.
We got to talk.

1726
01:44:40,952 --> 01:44:43,079
Get the hell
out of here.

1727
01:44:43,188 --> 01:44:44,678
I'm calling
the police.

1728
01:44:44,756 --> 01:44:46,155
Tell her to do it.

1729
01:44:46,424 --> 01:44:48,858
Fine. We want you
to call the police.

1730
01:44:48,994 --> 01:44:50,484
Let us in.

1731
01:44:50,595 --> 01:44:51,493
No.

1732
01:44:51,596 --> 01:44:52,995
Look, don't
you get it?

1733
01:44:53,131 --> 01:44:55,566
Sam wasn't just accidentally killed.
He was murdered.

1734
01:44:55,668 --> 01:44:59,001
He found out Carl was
laundering money at the bank.

1735
01:44:59,105 --> 01:45:00,868
This guy Carl
is dangerous.

1736
01:45:00,973 --> 01:45:02,873
He tried to kill me.

1737
01:45:02,975 --> 01:45:05,466
He's going to try
to kill you, too.

1738
01:45:05,578 --> 01:45:07,341
You're in
deep trouble.

1739
01:45:07,413 --> 01:45:09,745
Why are you
doing this to me?

1740
01:45:09,849 --> 01:45:14,750
Why are you
doing this to me?

1741
01:45:14,854 --> 01:45:17,448
I can't...
I just can't...

1742
01:45:17,556 --> 01:45:19,747
Oda Mae. Oda Mae,
tell her...

1743
01:45:19,926 --> 01:45:24,420
tell her she's wearing the shirt
that I spilled the margarita on

1744
01:45:24,530 --> 01:45:27,431
and the earrings
I gave her for Christmas.

1745
01:45:27,566 --> 01:45:30,900
Sam says you're wearing the shirt
he spilled the margarita on

1746
01:45:30,971 --> 01:45:33,906
and the earrings he
gave you for Christmas.

1747
01:45:39,646 --> 01:45:40,977
Don't you see?

1748
01:45:41,081 --> 01:45:43,572
I'm not a fake.
Not about this.

1749
01:45:48,488 --> 01:45:49,819
Give me a penny.

1750
01:45:49,923 --> 01:45:50,821
What?

1751
01:45:50,924 --> 01:45:53,552
Push a penny
under the door.

1752
01:45:53,660 --> 01:45:55,560
Push a penny
under the door?

1753
01:45:55,662 --> 01:45:56,560
Do it.

1754
01:46:34,235 --> 01:46:35,862
Tell her it's for luck.

1755
01:46:36,004 --> 01:46:37,904
Sam says
it's for luck.

1756
01:47:13,075 --> 01:47:15,976
We're between Green
and Mercer on Prince.

1757
01:47:16,078 --> 01:47:18,980
The gray building across
from the post office.

1758
01:47:19,082 --> 01:47:19,980
Thanks, Sergeant.

1759
01:47:20,083 --> 01:47:21,550
Please hurry.

1760
01:47:21,651 --> 01:47:22,982
We'll be waiting.

1761
01:47:23,086 --> 01:47:25,554
All right. They're
on their way.

1762
01:47:25,655 --> 01:47:26,553
Good.

1763
01:47:28,091 --> 01:47:30,559
So, what do we
do now?

1764
01:47:30,660 --> 01:47:31,854
Just wait.

1765
01:47:42,005 --> 01:47:43,495
Is Sam here?

1766
01:47:45,308 --> 01:47:46,240
Sam?

1767
01:47:48,011 --> 01:47:49,501
I'm sitting
beside her.

1768
01:47:51,581 --> 01:47:53,015
He's sitting
right beside you.

1769
01:48:03,327 --> 01:48:05,227
Sam, can you feel me?

1770
01:48:07,098 --> 01:48:08,531
With all my heart.

1771
01:48:09,834 --> 01:48:11,734
Says with all his heart.

1772
01:48:23,881 --> 01:48:25,212
I'd give anything

1773
01:48:25,316 --> 01:48:27,876
if I could just
touch you once more.

1774
01:48:30,989 --> 01:48:33,321
He says he wishes
he was alive again

1775
01:48:33,592 --> 01:48:35,355
so he could
touch you.

1776
01:48:39,097 --> 01:48:39,995
Me, too.

1777
01:48:57,182 --> 01:48:59,377
OK. OK. Look.

1778
01:48:59,651 --> 01:49:00,845
You can use me.

1779
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:03,252
Use you?

1780
01:49:03,321 --> 01:49:05,119
You can use
my body.

1781
01:49:05,224 --> 01:49:06,782
Use your body?

1782
01:49:06,893 --> 01:49:09,361
Just do it quick
before I change my mind.

1783
01:50:17,398 --> 01:50:24,140
"Oh, my love"

1784
01:50:24,505 --> 01:50:28,066
"My darlin"

1785
01:50:28,209 --> 01:50:33,977
"I've hungered
for your touch"

1786
01:50:35,450 --> 01:50:42,387
"A long, lonely time"

1787
01:50:46,227 --> 01:50:52,824
"And time goes by"

1788
01:50:53,535 --> 01:50:57,198
"So slowly"

1789
01:50:57,339 --> 01:51:02,806
"And time can do
so much"

1790
01:51:03,946 --> 01:51:10,037
"Are you still mine"

1791
01:51:12,321 --> 01:51:17,020
"I"

1792
01:51:17,126 --> 01:51:20,459
"Need your love"

1793
01:51:23,032 --> 01:51:26,433
"I"

1794
01:51:26,535 --> 01:51:29,835
"Need your love"

1795
01:51:29,939 --> 01:51:33,875
"Godspeed your love"

1796
01:51:33,977 --> 01:51:39,973
"To me"

1797
01:51:44,621 --> 01:51:47,852
"Lonely rivers flow"

1798
01:51:47,957 --> 01:51:49,584
"To the sea"

1799
01:51:49,859 --> 01:51:51,850
"To the sea"

1800
01:51:51,961 --> 01:51:55,362
"To the open arms"

1801
01:51:55,465 --> 01:51:57,365
"Of the sea"

1802
01:51:57,467 --> 01:51:59,230
"Yeah"

1803
01:51:59,302 --> 01:52:06,300
"Oh, my love"

1804
01:52:06,410 --> 01:52:10,005
"My darlin'"

1805
01:52:10,181 --> 01:52:12,172
"I've hungered"

1806
01:52:12,316 --> 01:52:14,045
"Hungered for your..."

1807
01:52:14,185 --> 01:52:15,209
Molly!

1808
01:52:17,488 --> 01:52:19,115
Molly,
are you home?

1809
01:52:19,223 --> 01:52:20,212
It's Carl.

1810
01:52:20,324 --> 01:52:21,951
Molly!

1811
01:52:22,059 --> 01:52:23,253
Fire escape.

1812
01:52:30,968 --> 01:52:32,265
What's happening to me?

1813
01:52:36,674 --> 01:52:37,572
Molly?

1814
01:52:39,344 --> 01:52:40,276
Molly?

1815
01:52:49,187 --> 01:52:50,154
Molly!

1816
01:52:51,289 --> 01:52:52,620
Son of a bitch!

1817
01:53:06,004 --> 01:53:06,936
Come on.

1818
01:53:10,509 --> 01:53:11,999
Oh. Look. Look.

1819
01:53:13,345 --> 01:53:14,870
Oh. Let's go.
Let's go.

1820
01:53:15,014 --> 01:53:15,946
All right.

1821
01:53:25,358 --> 01:53:26,290
Molly!

1822
01:53:26,359 --> 01:53:28,293
Just get away
from us, Carl.

1823
01:53:32,098 --> 01:53:32,996
Molly!

1824
01:53:33,099 --> 01:53:34,430
You're just a liar.

1825
01:53:34,534 --> 01:53:36,934
Listen to me.
This woman's a thief.

1826
01:53:37,036 --> 01:53:38,230
She's a con artist.

1827
01:53:38,337 --> 01:53:39,964
Why are you
doing this?

1828
01:53:40,039 --> 01:53:41,233
Don't listen to her.

1829
01:53:42,375 --> 01:53:43,364
Stop!

1830
01:53:43,509 --> 01:53:46,410
Just get away
from us, Carl.

1831
01:53:46,512 --> 01:53:48,002
I've called
the police.

1832
01:53:57,591 --> 01:53:58,523
Shit.

1833
01:54:01,061 --> 01:54:03,052
Why are you
doing this?

1834
01:54:03,163 --> 01:54:04,494
Don't interfere!
She's a thief!

1835
01:54:06,700 --> 01:54:08,930
All right.
Give me the check.

1836
01:54:09,036 --> 01:54:09,934
Carl, no!

1837
01:54:10,037 --> 01:54:11,334
Out of this, Molly!

1838
01:54:18,345 --> 01:54:20,905
Keep out of this,
Molly!

1839
01:54:21,081 --> 01:54:22,343
Give me the check!

1840
01:54:22,483 --> 01:54:23,950
Get off of me!

1841
01:54:28,490 --> 01:54:29,718
Where is it?

1842
01:54:29,991 --> 01:54:31,083
Where is it?

1843
01:54:31,192 --> 01:54:32,682
Where is it,
god damn it?

1844
01:54:32,794 --> 01:54:34,284
I gave it away.

1845
01:54:34,395 --> 01:54:35,362
You're lying.

1846
01:54:35,463 --> 01:54:38,990
Don't... lie to me,
god damn it!

1847
01:54:41,035 --> 01:54:41,967
The check.

1848
01:54:55,149 --> 01:54:56,411
Watch out, Sam!

1849
01:54:56,551 --> 01:54:59,019
I swear to God
I'll kill her!

1850
01:55:04,226 --> 01:55:06,194
Now, just...

1851
01:55:06,295 --> 01:55:07,227
look.

1852
01:55:07,296 --> 01:55:09,764
Just give me
the check, Sam, OK?

1853
01:55:10,032 --> 01:55:12,523
I promise you
I'll let her go

1854
01:55:12,635 --> 01:55:15,399
if you just
give it to me. OK?

1855
01:55:17,172 --> 01:55:18,070
Sam?

1856
01:55:20,476 --> 01:55:21,374
Sam?

1857
01:56:38,689 --> 01:56:39,621
Sam?

1858
01:56:42,493 --> 01:56:44,393
Oh, Carl.

1859
01:56:44,462 --> 01:56:45,394
What?

1860
01:57:09,755 --> 01:57:11,188
What?

1861
01:57:18,430 --> 01:57:19,829
Ooh! Help!

1862
01:57:52,999 --> 01:57:54,796
Are you two all right?

1863
01:57:59,439 --> 01:58:00,338
Sam?

1864
01:58:03,310 --> 01:58:04,242
Molly?

1865
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:08,370
I can hear you.

1866
01:58:45,386 --> 01:58:46,546
Oh, God.

1867
01:59:34,570 --> 01:59:36,299
Sam?

1868
01:59:36,405 --> 01:59:38,339
They're waiting
for you, Sam.

1869
01:59:49,786 --> 01:59:51,276
I'll miss you.

1870
01:59:52,956 --> 01:59:55,015
Your mother
would be proud.

1871
01:59:55,325 --> 01:59:58,624
I'm going to miss
you, too, Sam.

1872
01:59:58,728 --> 02:00:00,059
You're all right.

1873
02:00:01,998 --> 02:00:03,431
Bye, Oda Mae.

1874
02:00:05,335 --> 02:00:06,063
Bye, Sam.

1875
02:00:29,393 --> 02:00:30,690
I love you, Molly.

1876
02:00:33,397 --> 02:00:35,456
I've always loved you.

1877
02:00:42,206 --> 02:00:43,104
Ditto.

1878
02:01:04,596 --> 02:01:05,927
It's amazing, Molly.

1879
02:01:07,599 --> 02:01:09,032
The love inside...

1880
02:01:09,167 --> 02:01:11,101
you take it
with you.

1881
02:01:23,181 --> 02:01:24,079
See ya.

1882
02:01:32,090 --> 02:01:33,022
See ya.

1883
02:01:52,512 --> 02:01:53,706
Bye.
