1
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:22,789
<i>My name is Max.</i>

2
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:26,225
<i>My world is fire and blood.</i>

3
00:00:26,325 --> 00:00:27,760
<i>Why are you hurting these people?</i>

4
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,329
- <i>It's the oil, stupid.</i>
- <i>Oil wars.</i>

5
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:32,365
<i>We are killing for guzzoline.</i>

6
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:34,267
<i>The world is actually
running out of water.</i>

7
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:37,603
<i>Now there's the water wars.</i>

8
00:00:37,703 --> 00:00:40,239
<i>Once, I was a cop,</i>

9
00:00:40,339 --> 00:00:43,175
<i>a road warrior searching
for a righteous cause.</i>

10
00:00:43,275 --> 00:00:44,911
<i>...to the terminal freak-out point.</i>

11
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:48,114
<i>Mankind has gone rogue,
terrorizing itself.</i>

12
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,749
<i>Thermonuclear skirmish.</i>

13
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:52,585
- <i>The earth is sour.</i>
- <i>Our bones are poisoned.</i>

14
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:55,755
<i>We have become half-life.</i>

15
00:00:55,855 --> 00:01:01,260
<i>As the world fell, each of us,
in our own way, was broken.</i>

16
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,355
<i>It was hard to know
who was more crazy...</i>

17
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:10,293
<i>me or everyone else.</i>

18
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:14,998
<i>Hello?</i>

19
00:01:16,308 --> 00:01:18,268
<i>Where are you?</i>

20
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,218
<i>Where are you, Max?</i>

21
00:01:26,318 --> 00:01:28,588
- <i>Here they come again.</i>
- <i>Max Rockatansky.</i>

22
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:32,058
<i>Worming their way
into the black matter of my brain.</i>

23
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:34,985
- <i>Help us, Max.</i>
- <i>You promised to help us.</i>

24
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:42,700
<i>I tell myself... they cannot touch me.</i>

25
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,870
<i>They are long dead.</i>

26
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:20,330
After him!

27
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:24,134
After him!

28
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,140
Now!

29
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:49,535
<i>I am the one who runs
from both the living and the dead,</i>

30
00:02:49,635 --> 00:02:52,704
<i>hunted by scavengers,</i>

31
00:02:52,804 --> 00:02:55,599
<i>haunted by those I could not protect.</i>

32
00:03:05,117 --> 00:03:08,513
<i>So I exist in this wasteland.</i>

33
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:17,196
<i>A man reduced to a single instinct...</i>

34
00:03:17,296 --> 00:03:19,489
<i>survive.</i>

35
00:04:38,944 --> 00:04:42,973
Max? Is that you? Where were you?

36
00:04:45,284 --> 00:04:48,754
Help us. Where were you?
Help us, Max. Where were you, Max?

37
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,850
Stop running, Max. Stop running.

38
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:09,933
You let us die.

39
00:05:11,043 --> 00:05:12,378
You let us die!

40
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,180
You let us die!

41
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,081
You promised to help us.

42
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:38,292
Witness!

43
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:33,059
- We are War Boys!
- War Boys!

44
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,329
- Kamakrazee War Boys!
- War Boys!

45
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:40,132
Fucacima Kamakrazee War Boys!

46
00:06:40,232 --> 00:06:42,234
Hooked on!

47
00:06:43,134 --> 00:06:47,039
- Today we're headin' to Gas Town!
- Gas Town!

48
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:51,402
- Today we're haulin' Aqua Cola.
- Aqua cola!

49
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:54,947
- Today we're haulin' produce!
- Produce!

50
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:57,617
And today we're haulin' mother's milk!

51
00:06:57,717 --> 00:07:00,186
Mother's milk!

52
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:52,371
Rev it up for the Immortan Joe!

53
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,915
Once again, we send off my war rig

54
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:06,318
to bring back guzzoline from Gas Town

55
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:09,355
and bullets from The Bullet Farm.

56
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:15,427
Once again,
I salute my imperator, Furiosa!

57
00:08:15,627 --> 00:08:19,598
And I salute my half-life War Boys

58
00:08:19,698 --> 00:08:22,234
who will ride with me eternal

59
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:26,255
on the highways of Valhalla.

60
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:30,109
I am your redeemer!

61
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:32,878
It is by my hand

62
00:08:32,978 --> 00:08:38,150
you will rise from the ashes
of this world!

63
00:08:45,657 --> 00:08:47,993
It's comin'. Get ready.

64
00:08:48,093 --> 00:08:52,531
Yes. Yes. Yes. It's comin'.

65
00:09:48,687 --> 00:09:53,258
Do not, my friends,
become addicted to water.

66
00:09:53,358 --> 00:09:59,130
It will take hold of you.
And you will resent its absence.

67
00:10:23,021 --> 00:10:25,491
Get 'em all off!

68
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:28,060
Get 'em all off!

69
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,820
Clear off!

70
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:42,332
Signal Gas Town. Convoy's on its way.

71
00:11:08,867 --> 00:11:11,837
I got a War Boy runnin' on empty.

72
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:14,497
Hook up that full-life.

73
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:20,579
Careful. That's a universal donor.

74
00:12:17,468 --> 00:12:20,129
Boss, we're not going to Gas Town?

75
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,350
Bullet Farm?

76
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,248
We're heading east.

77
00:12:29,347 --> 00:12:31,717
I'll pass it down the line.

78
00:12:32,217 --> 00:12:35,287
New orders! Thunder up! Thunder up!

79
00:12:35,787 --> 00:12:37,589
This is not a supply run!

80
00:12:37,989 --> 00:12:40,678
- Go. Go. Go.
- Ace, what's going on?

81
00:12:40,778 --> 00:12:42,127
- We're heading east.
- Why?

82
00:12:42,227 --> 00:12:44,788
I don't know. That's the order.

83
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:03,215
Moo.

84
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:06,809
Hey, pa. You know about this?

85
00:13:06,909 --> 00:13:10,113
Your produce ain't going to Gas Town.

86
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:23,669
She's gone off-road...
into hostile territory.

87
00:13:25,569 --> 00:13:27,950
Why would she do that, Dad?

88
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,376
- Let me see. Let me see. I wanna see!
- Rictus.

89
00:13:31,476 --> 00:13:35,572
Rictus, go see what's agitating Dad!

90
00:14:02,774 --> 00:14:05,310
Splendid!

91
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,137
Angharad!

92
00:14:16,654 --> 00:14:17,856
Where are they?

93
00:14:17,956 --> 00:14:19,925
They are not your property.

94
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,661
- Miss Giddy?
- You cannot own a human being.

95
00:14:23,761 --> 00:14:26,131
Sooner or later someone pushes back!

96
00:14:26,281 --> 00:14:28,604
Where is she taking them?!

97
00:14:28,704 --> 00:14:31,495
She didn't take them.
They begged her to go.

98
00:14:33,004 --> 00:14:36,608
- Where is she taking them?
- A long way from you.

99
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,894
Hey, what's happening?

100
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:09,675
Slit. What's going on? Slit!

101
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:12,644
Treason, betrayal,
an imperator gone rogue.

102
00:15:12,744 --> 00:15:14,246
An imperator. Who?

103
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:17,449
Furiosa. She took a lot of stuff
from Immortan Joe.

104
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:20,786
- What stuff?
- Breeders. His prize breeders.

105
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:23,513
He wants them back.
Not a hand laid on 'em.

106
00:15:30,495 --> 00:15:33,690
By my deeds, I honor him. V-8.

107
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:47,746
- That's my wheel.
- I'm driving.

108
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:50,549
- You're my lancer.
- I just promoted myself.

109
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:53,285
- Not today. Today is my day.
- Look at you!

110
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,354
If you can't stand up, you can't do war!

111
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:59,023
- He's right, son.
- I'm not staying here dying soft.

112
00:15:59,123 --> 00:16:01,301
You're already a corpse.

113
00:16:01,401 --> 00:16:04,062
- I just need a top-up, some more juice.
- There's no time!

114
00:16:04,162 --> 00:16:07,666
We take my blood bag. We take my blood bag
and strap him to the lancer's perch.

115
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,841
It's got a muzzle on it.
It's a raging feral.

116
00:16:09,941 --> 00:16:12,696
That's right. High-octane
crazy blood fillin' me up.

117
00:16:17,862 --> 00:16:19,912
If I'm gonna die...

118
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,147
I'm gonna die historic on the fury road.

119
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,824
- Yeah. Yeah. Organic.
- Yeah?

120
00:16:32,924 --> 00:16:35,442
- Hitch up his blood bag.
- Right-o.

121
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:44,269
Yeah!

122
00:16:45,569 --> 00:16:50,100
How much more can they take from me?
They've got my blood. Now it's my car!

123
00:17:27,878 --> 00:17:29,685
Immortan!

124
00:17:30,081 --> 00:17:32,580
Immortan Joe!

125
00:17:34,452 --> 00:17:35,921
He looked at me!

126
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:39,491
- He looked right at me!
- He looked at your blood bag!

127
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,994
He turned his head.
He looked me straight in the eye.

128
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,396
He was scanning the horizon.

129
00:17:44,905 --> 00:17:47,799
No. I am awaited.

130
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:49,993
I am awaited in Valhalla!

131
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,497
<i>Confucamus!</i>

132
00:17:56,908 --> 00:17:59,411
Immortan!

133
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:01,504
Yeah!

134
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:23,193
- Hey! Heads up!
- Heads up!

135
00:18:28,205 --> 00:18:30,160
Boss!

136
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,111
We got vehicles from The Citadel.
They're firing flares.

137
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:36,414
They want reinforcements
from Gas Town and The Bullet Farm.

138
00:18:36,514 --> 00:18:38,784
What is this? Backup? Decoy?

139
00:18:40,238 --> 00:18:41,711
It's a detour.

140
00:19:13,985 --> 00:19:16,160
Eyes right.

141
00:19:18,253 --> 00:19:21,726
Buzzards! Buzzards right!
Eyes on! Eyes on!

142
00:19:21,826 --> 00:19:23,762
Buzzards right! Eyes on!

143
00:19:24,262 --> 00:19:25,263
Yeah!

144
00:19:26,663 --> 00:19:30,268
Should we turn it 'round
and run 'em into our backup?

145
00:19:31,355 --> 00:19:33,767
No. We're good.

146
00:19:33,867 --> 00:19:35,786
We fang it!

147
00:19:38,576 --> 00:19:41,395
Thunder up! Here we go!

148
00:19:43,675 --> 00:19:45,408
Prepare the gunners!

149
00:20:14,512 --> 00:20:16,787
Morsov!

150
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,444
Come on, attack!

151
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,084
War!

152
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,800
Ready!

153
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,422
She's ours, Slit! She's ours.

154
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:33,324
First, we get the buzzards off her back!

155
00:21:38,963 --> 00:21:41,261
Form up!

156
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:46,407
That's my head!

157
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:22,899
Get up! You can do it!

158
00:22:27,745 --> 00:22:28,780
Morsov!

159
00:22:30,321 --> 00:22:32,620
- Morsov!
- No!

160
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,755
- Witness me!
- Witness!

161
00:22:46,864 --> 00:22:48,446
Witness!

162
00:22:50,034 --> 00:22:54,424
Mediocre, Morsov! Mediocre!

163
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:15,118
Ready!

164
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:25,995
Get ready!

165
00:23:27,972 --> 00:23:29,886
Back me in!

166
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:34,203
They're coming!

167
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:55,158
- We can't breathe down there!
- Stay out of sight!

168
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:57,393
Now!

169
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:10,682
Go back!

170
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:14,995
Hydraulics! Hydraulics!

171
00:24:36,874 --> 00:24:38,843
Yeah.

172
00:24:43,146 --> 00:24:45,916
Now we bring home the Booty.

173
00:25:11,709 --> 00:25:13,678
She thinks she can lose us, Dad.

174
00:25:13,978 --> 00:25:18,541
She thinks we're stupid.
She thinks she can lose us in there!

175
00:25:37,301 --> 00:25:40,038
Fang it! Fang it!

176
00:25:46,376 --> 00:25:48,165
Why can't you stop?

177
00:25:48,665 --> 00:25:51,116
Crew! Outta the way! Out of the way!

178
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,910
What have you done? What have you done?!

179
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:19,200
We need counterweight.
Get the blood bag down the back.

180
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:32,514
Hunt them down! Hunt them down!

181
00:26:57,481 --> 00:26:59,818
Hey, head... say bye-bye to the neck!

182
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:02,478
- <i>Decapito!</i>
- We're goin' in, Slit!

183
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:07,310
Come on! We've almost got her!

184
00:28:15,926 --> 00:28:18,486
Come on! Hold it steady!

185
00:28:45,755 --> 00:28:48,284
Oh, what a day! What a lovely day!

186
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,107
I am the man... who grabs the sun...

187
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:17,267
riding to Valhalla!

188
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:20,916
Witness me, blood bag!

189
00:29:24,428 --> 00:29:26,689
Witness!

190
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,981
I live, I die, I live again!

191
00:33:35,045 --> 00:33:37,556
We're not going back.

192
00:34:05,575 --> 00:34:07,544
Water.

193
00:35:02,398 --> 00:35:04,417
You.

194
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:23,445
Angharad, is that just the wind,
or is it a furious vexation?

195
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,269
I got it!

196
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:38,489
Glory me, blood bag!
We snagged her alive.

197
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:41,258
He's gonna shred her. Shred her!

198
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:43,127
Bolt cutters.

199
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:45,087
Chain.

200
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,155
Hey, hey!

201
00:37:50,667 --> 00:37:52,369
Oh, look at them.

202
00:37:52,969 --> 00:37:56,941
So shiny, so chrome.
He's gonna be so grateful.

203
00:37:58,041 --> 00:38:00,411
We could ask for anything.

204
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:02,213
I wanna drive the war rig.

205
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:05,516
- What are you gonna ask for?
- That's my jacket.

206
00:38:06,316 --> 00:38:08,317
Sure.

207
00:38:08,417 --> 00:38:09,920
I mean, you can ask
for more than a jacket.

208
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,355
We're going to the Green Place.

209
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,215
Wait, it's you and me.

210
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:29,906
We're going to the Green Place
of Many Mothers.

211
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,759
How does it feel?

212
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:53,730
- It hurts.
- Out here, everything hurts.

213
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,458
You wanna get through this?

214
00:39:00,335 --> 00:39:02,556
Do as I say.

215
00:39:06,276 --> 00:39:09,037
Now pick up what you can and run.

216
00:39:51,087 --> 00:39:52,481
Kill switches.

217
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:57,786
I set the sequence myself.
This rig goes nowhere without me.

218
00:40:01,831 --> 00:40:03,434
You can get in.

219
00:40:04,419 --> 00:40:05,694
Not without them.

220
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:16,680
So we wait.

221
00:40:24,386 --> 00:40:26,690
You're relying on the gratitude
of a very bad man.

222
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:29,851
You've already damaged one of his wives.
How grateful do you think he's gonna be?

223
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:40,170
You're sitting on 2,000 horsepower
of nitro-boosted war machine.

224
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:44,333
I'd say you've got
about a five-minute head start.

225
00:40:51,918 --> 00:40:54,776
You want that thing off your face?

226
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,189
Let's go.

227
00:41:51,701 --> 00:41:55,337
Of all the legs you had to shoot,
that one was attached to his favorite.

228
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:16,925
Smeg!

229
00:42:37,253 --> 00:42:39,089
You don't have to do it
just because he tells you.

230
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:41,858
- What choice does she have?
- He's not gonna hurt us. He needs us.

231
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:43,026
- Why?
- To bargain.

232
00:42:43,126 --> 00:42:44,328
Oh, he'll hurt us, all right.

233
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:46,017
Do you think he's coming
to the Green Place?

234
00:42:46,117 --> 00:42:49,091
Never! He's a crazy smeg
who eats <i>schlanger!</i>

235
00:43:16,192 --> 00:43:18,262
- Stay out of there.
- Behind you.

236
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:24,535
The Gas Town boys.

237
00:43:26,369 --> 00:43:28,497
Don't damage the goods.

238
00:43:34,842 --> 00:43:36,138
What do you see?

239
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:40,484
Big Rigs.

240
00:43:41,584 --> 00:43:43,653
Polecats.

241
00:43:43,753 --> 00:43:45,789
Flamers.

242
00:43:46,689 --> 00:43:49,159
And there's the People Eater himself.

243
00:43:50,428 --> 00:43:52,362
Coming to count the cost.

244
00:44:08,511 --> 00:44:12,149
We're dragging something out back.
I think it's the fuel pod.

245
00:44:13,133 --> 00:44:15,265
No, no.

246
00:44:15,665 --> 00:44:17,562
I'll go.

247
00:45:40,537 --> 00:45:43,097
Filth! You traited him!

248
00:45:46,776 --> 00:45:47,880
No unnecessary killing!

249
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:50,692
- This War Boy wants me dead!
- We agreed!

250
00:45:50,792 --> 00:45:52,482
He's Kamakrazee!

251
00:45:53,082 --> 00:45:54,985
He's just a kid at the end
of his half-life.

252
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:57,854
No! I live, I die, I live again!

253
00:45:57,954 --> 00:45:59,662
- Hold him!
- Tie him up!

254
00:45:59,762 --> 00:46:01,273
Throw him out!

255
00:46:01,373 --> 00:46:03,242
Chuck him out.

256
00:46:03,342 --> 00:46:05,128
You got more friends.

257
00:46:07,463 --> 00:46:10,710
Bullet Farmer.
They're coming from The Bullet Farm.

258
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:12,297
Yeah?

259
00:46:12,397 --> 00:46:14,772
It's over. You can't defy him.

260
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:16,940
- Watch us, mate.
- He is the one who grabbed the sun.

261
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,875
Look at how slick
he's fooled you, War Boy!

262
00:46:18,975 --> 00:46:21,945
- He's a lying old man.
- By his hand, we'll be lifted up!

263
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:24,548
That's why we have his logo
seared on our backs!

264
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:26,350
"Breeding stock!" "Battle fodder!"

265
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,553
- No, I am awaited!
- You're an old man's battle fodder!

266
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:32,222
- Killing everyone and everything!
- We're not to blame!

267
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:34,391
Then who killed the world?

268
00:47:02,083 --> 00:47:04,726
I made a deal up ahead. Safe passage.

269
00:47:04,826 --> 00:47:07,057
I don't know if it's still any good.

270
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:11,086
Get back in the hold!
Keep the hatch open.

271
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:19,640
I need you here.

272
00:47:20,803 --> 00:47:22,172
You may have to drive the rig.

273
00:47:28,072 --> 00:47:29,751
You.

274
00:47:29,946 --> 00:47:31,761
You stay.

275
00:47:31,861 --> 00:47:34,042
You stay there.

276
00:47:36,953 --> 00:47:39,222
Whatever you do, you can't be seen.

277
00:47:39,522 --> 00:47:43,084
I'm supposed to be alone.
That was the deal.

278
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:51,625
Down here.

279
00:48:11,723 --> 00:48:13,688
Hey.

280
00:48:13,788 --> 00:48:15,933
What's your name?

281
00:48:16,933 --> 00:48:19,197
What do I call you?

282
00:48:19,297 --> 00:48:21,630
Does it matter?

283
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:24,353
Fine.

284
00:48:24,453 --> 00:48:27,862
When I yell "fool," you drive
out of here as fast as you can.

285
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:32,698
This is the sequence... one.

286
00:48:32,798 --> 00:48:35,312
One, two. One.

287
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,848
Red, black, go.

288
00:48:38,648 --> 00:48:40,786
You have it?

289
00:50:05,368 --> 00:50:07,070
It's all here!

290
00:50:08,064 --> 00:50:11,065
Three thousand gallons of guzzoline,
just like you asked!

291
00:50:15,044 --> 00:50:16,746
I'm gonna unhitch the pod.

292
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:21,532
You drop the rocks.

293
00:50:28,858 --> 00:50:33,763
You said, "a few vehicles
in pursuit. Maybe."

294
00:50:33,863 --> 00:50:36,633
We count three war parties!

295
00:50:37,233 --> 00:50:40,728
Yeah, well, I got unlucky.
Let's do this!

296
00:51:07,295 --> 00:51:08,465
Fool!

297
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,974
That's our fuel!

298
00:52:05,488 --> 00:52:08,258
Make way for the ripsaw!

299
00:52:22,771 --> 00:52:26,577
Once I'm over, clear the rocks
and bring everyone through.

300
00:52:26,677 --> 00:52:29,913
Immortan! Immortan Joe!

301
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:33,707
I got a War Boy!
Says he was on the war rig!

302
00:52:35,767 --> 00:52:38,708
You! Climb aboard!

303
00:52:39,789 --> 00:52:41,057
Hey! Hey!

304
00:52:42,157 --> 00:52:46,063
I got his boot!
I got the blood bag's boot!

305
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:49,933
Take me! I got his boot!

306
00:52:51,506 --> 00:52:53,903
All this for a family squabble.

307
00:52:54,803 --> 00:52:57,006
Healthy babies.

308
00:55:04,366 --> 00:55:06,344
Reload the clip.

309
00:55:06,444 --> 00:55:08,872
I can't.

310
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:16,013
Gun!

311
00:55:16,863 --> 00:55:18,481
- Give the gun!
- It's not loaded yet!

312
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:21,075
- You! We had a deal!
- Now!

313
00:56:09,498 --> 00:56:10,800
Rictus!

314
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,761
The wives! No more flames.

315
00:56:20,292 --> 00:56:21,744
Splendid!

316
00:56:22,244 --> 00:56:27,074
Splendid! That's my child! My property!

317
00:56:29,169 --> 00:56:31,342
Immorta...

318
00:56:39,835 --> 00:56:43,666
Immortan, if I get on the rig,
there's a way inside.

319
00:56:43,766 --> 00:56:46,268
- What is your name?
- It's Nux.

320
00:56:46,368 --> 00:56:48,504
I'll pike her in the spine.
Keep her breathing for ya.

321
00:56:48,704 --> 00:56:49,806
No.

322
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:54,577
Put a bullet in her skull, stop the rig,
return my treasures to me,

323
00:56:54,877 --> 00:57:00,683
and I myself will carry you
to the gates of Valhalla.

324
00:57:01,083 --> 00:57:03,019
Am I awaited?

325
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:07,757
You will ride eternal...
shiny and chrome.

326
00:57:08,657 --> 00:57:10,426
Rictus!

327
00:57:10,526 --> 00:57:12,495
Help him aboard!

328
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,452
Ready?

329
00:57:15,552 --> 00:57:17,729
Here we go!

330
00:57:28,643 --> 00:57:30,805
Mediocre!

331
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:02,068
<i>Schlanger!</i>

332
00:58:21,697 --> 00:58:22,890
Look out!

333
00:58:25,968 --> 00:58:29,430
Angharad! Get out!

334
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:52,086
- No!
- Angharad!

335
00:59:06,742 --> 00:59:09,203
Stop! Turn the rig around!

336
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:12,203
Go back for her!

337
00:59:12,983 --> 00:59:15,784
- No.
- Tell him to turn the rig around!

338
00:59:15,884 --> 00:59:19,455
- Did you see it?
- She went under the wheels.

339
00:59:19,555 --> 00:59:21,891
Did you see it?

340
00:59:22,591 --> 00:59:24,293
She went under the wheels.

341
00:59:25,694 --> 00:59:27,550
- We keep moving.
- No!

342
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:31,106
- We keep moving!
- He doesn't know what he's talking about!

343
00:59:31,206 --> 00:59:33,178
Whatever happens,
we're going to the Green Place.

344
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:35,671
The stupid Green Place.
We don't even know where to find it.

345
00:59:48,492 --> 00:59:51,521
- You all right?
- On! On!

346
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:29,959
Cheedo!

347
01:00:30,659 --> 01:00:31,994
Cheedo, don't be stupid.

348
01:00:32,194 --> 01:00:34,830
- Stop!
- He'll forgive us. I know he will.

349
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:37,867
- There is no going back!
- We were his treasures!

350
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,702
- Cheedo!
- We were protected.

351
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,004
He gave us the high life.

352
01:00:41,104 --> 01:00:43,239
- What's wrong with that?
- We are not things.

353
01:00:44,407 --> 01:00:46,311
No!

354
01:00:46,811 --> 01:00:49,512
- Cheedo, we are not things!
- We are not things.

355
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:52,381
- I don't want to hear that again!
- They were her words!

356
01:00:52,481 --> 01:00:54,817
And now she's dead!

357
01:00:55,117 --> 01:00:56,343
Wring your hands.

358
01:00:58,487 --> 01:01:01,524
- You're not going back to him.
- Angharad!

359
01:01:01,624 --> 01:01:04,050
Come on! Come on!

360
01:01:20,786 --> 01:01:23,013
So...

361
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:26,049
Where is this...

362
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:28,851
This Green Place?

363
01:01:29,451 --> 01:01:31,454
It's a long night's run, heading east.

364
01:01:34,019 --> 01:01:38,451
We need inventory. I want you
to match every gun with its bullets.

365
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:43,432
I'm gonna go down and do some repairs.

366
01:01:43,632 --> 01:01:46,035
- We need someone down the back.
- I'll go.

367
01:01:46,435 --> 01:01:49,572
No. I want you to stay together.

368
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:51,265
I can do it.

369
01:02:24,072 --> 01:02:26,474
What are you doing here?

370
01:02:26,574 --> 01:02:30,812
He saw it. He saw it all.

371
01:02:31,382 --> 01:02:35,274
My own blood bag
drivin' the rig that killed her.

372
01:02:41,724 --> 01:02:43,984
Stop doing that.

373
01:02:46,462 --> 01:02:47,388
Stop.

374
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:00,376
Thr... three times
the gates were open to me.

375
01:03:00,876 --> 01:03:02,387
What gates?

376
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:06,747
I was awaited in Valhalla.
They were calling my name.

377
01:03:06,847 --> 01:03:10,511
I should be walking with the immorta,
mcfeasting with the heroes of all time.

378
01:03:13,989 --> 01:03:17,526
I'd say it was
your manifest destiny not to.

379
01:03:18,926 --> 01:03:21,664
I thought I was being spared
for something great.

380
01:03:21,764 --> 01:03:26,034
I got to drive a pursuit vehicle.

381
01:03:26,134 --> 01:03:29,372
For a while even Larry and Barry
stopped chewing on my windpipe.

382
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,207
Who are Larry and Barry?

383
01:03:32,107 --> 01:03:35,544
My mates. Larry and Barry.

384
01:03:37,144 --> 01:03:40,774
If they don't get me,
then the night fevers will.

385
01:04:04,424 --> 01:04:09,477
Well, we've only got four for big boy here,
so he's all but useless.

386
01:04:09,577 --> 01:04:16,018
But we can squirt off this little pinky
a raunchy 29 times.

387
01:04:17,426 --> 01:04:19,422
Angharad used to call them antiseed.

388
01:04:20,519 --> 01:04:23,821
Plant one and watch something die.

389
01:05:57,944 --> 01:06:01,056
We are down 30,000 units of guzzoline,

390
01:06:01,156 --> 01:06:04,993
19 canisters of nitro, 12 assault bikes,

391
01:06:05,093 --> 01:06:08,063
7 pursuit vehicles. The deficit mounts.

392
01:06:08,163 --> 01:06:12,635
And now, sir, you have us
stuck in a quagmire.

393
01:06:13,235 --> 01:06:14,570
Hey, Joe!

394
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:16,639
Boss!

395
01:06:18,496 --> 01:06:21,167
Your girly's breathing her last!

396
01:06:21,267 --> 01:06:23,789
What about the child?

397
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:35,857
- Are ya comin', brother?
- Wait!

398
01:06:36,291 --> 01:06:41,521
- It's gone awful quiet in there.
- Get it out. Get it out!

399
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,834
Come on!
I've been called to the torture!

400
01:06:46,858 --> 01:06:49,113
Patience!

401
01:06:49,592 --> 01:06:51,907
Oh, you stay here
with your grief, Daddy.

402
01:06:52,207 --> 01:06:56,969
- I'll fetch 'em for ya.
- Be careful! Protect the assets!

403
01:06:58,013 --> 01:07:00,683
Just one angry shot...

404
01:07:00,783 --> 01:07:02,655
for Furiosa.

405
01:07:02,755 --> 01:07:04,963
Hut!

406
01:07:11,256 --> 01:07:13,729
Cryin' shame.

407
01:07:14,129 --> 01:07:15,949
Come.

408
01:07:16,349 --> 01:07:17,958
Nother month...

409
01:07:18,058 --> 01:07:20,069
Could've been your viable human.

410
01:07:20,169 --> 01:07:23,230
- Was it a male?
- Your a-one Alpha prime.

411
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:28,679
Hey, Rictus!

412
01:07:29,079 --> 01:07:31,643
You lost a baby brother.

413
01:07:33,348 --> 01:07:36,141
Perfect in every way.

414
01:07:37,852 --> 01:07:41,957
I had a baby brother!
I had a little baby brother!

415
01:07:42,057 --> 01:07:46,852
And he was perfect!
Perfect in every way!

416
01:08:16,692 --> 01:08:17,804
Come on.

417
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:30,381
- Wouldn't wanna shoot the wives, sir.
- Just probing.

418
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:44,186
- He wants to help!
- Who?!

419
01:08:44,586 --> 01:08:47,024
- The War Boy!
- Where did he come from?!

420
01:08:47,124 --> 01:08:50,083
I thought we threw him off the rig!

421
01:08:53,662 --> 01:08:55,731
There's high ground
just beyond that thing.

422
01:08:55,831 --> 01:08:59,568
- He means the tree.
- Yeah. Tree!

423
01:09:00,368 --> 01:09:02,871
- Leave him to me.
- Say, anyone notice that bright light?

424
01:09:02,971 --> 01:09:05,340
Encroaching gunfire?

425
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:07,376
- Get out.
- I can do this. I know this machine.

426
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:09,150
He does. He's a revhead.

427
01:09:14,783 --> 01:09:17,394
You've got two left.

428
01:09:22,290 --> 01:09:24,249
On him.

429
01:09:41,042 --> 01:09:43,069
Don't breathe.

430
01:09:46,748 --> 01:09:49,918
Hey! Hey! Hey! War Boy!

431
01:09:50,018 --> 01:09:52,721
I'm gonna use the winch
'round the tree thing!

432
01:09:53,727 --> 01:09:56,859
Take this. Let's get the engine plates.

433
01:09:58,059 --> 01:09:59,027
You drive the rig!

434
01:09:59,327 --> 01:10:01,829
- Hold up a flare.
- I am holding a flare!

435
01:10:01,929 --> 01:10:05,167
- Closer.
- It's right in front of your eyes!

436
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:19,471
Hut! Hut!

437
01:10:24,686 --> 01:10:26,626
Blood bag!

438
01:10:32,261 --> 01:10:34,963
I am the scales of justice!

439
01:10:35,063 --> 01:10:39,291
Conductor of the choir of death!

440
01:10:42,037 --> 01:10:44,847
Sing, brother koch!

441
01:10:46,595 --> 01:10:50,145
Sing, brothers, sing! Sing!

442
01:10:51,345 --> 01:10:53,814
Don't they know they're shooting at us?

443
01:11:07,296 --> 01:11:09,625
Gun fever!

444
01:12:19,033 --> 01:12:21,103
I never thought I'd do something
as shine as that.

445
01:12:21,703 --> 01:12:23,838
How are the engines?

446
01:12:23,938 --> 01:12:26,498
Very hot and real thirsty.

447
01:12:30,144 --> 01:12:35,283
Hey. You need to take the war rig
half a click down the track.

448
01:12:35,383 --> 01:12:38,978
What if you're not back
by the time the engines have cooled?

449
01:12:40,488 --> 01:12:43,282
Well, you keep moving.

450
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:53,401
What do you suppose he's gonna do?

451
01:12:54,535 --> 01:12:57,104
Retaliate first.

452
01:12:59,507 --> 01:13:01,600
Let's go!

453
01:14:20,555 --> 01:14:22,990
Are you hurt?

454
01:14:23,425 --> 01:14:26,662
- You're bleeding.
- That's not his blood.

455
01:14:28,563 --> 01:14:30,532
What is this?

456
01:14:30,832 --> 01:14:33,375
It's mother's milk.

457
01:15:14,541 --> 01:15:16,845
It's okay. Sleep.

458
01:15:18,101 --> 01:15:20,339
Get some rest.

459
01:15:30,057 --> 01:15:33,219
How do you know this place even exists?

460
01:15:35,297 --> 01:15:36,756
I was born there.

461
01:15:39,133 --> 01:15:40,602
So why'd you leave?

462
01:15:40,702 --> 01:15:43,304
I didn't.

463
01:15:43,404 --> 01:15:45,231
I was taken as a child.

464
01:15:47,075 --> 01:15:48,549
Stolen.

465
01:15:54,315 --> 01:15:57,826
- You done this before?
- Many times.

466
01:15:59,019 --> 01:16:02,290
Now that I drive a war rig...

467
01:16:02,890 --> 01:16:04,891
this is the best shot I'll ever have.

468
01:16:06,126 --> 01:16:07,229
And them?

469
01:16:09,135 --> 01:16:11,799
They're looking for hope.

470
01:16:11,899 --> 01:16:14,526
What about you?

471
01:16:18,673 --> 01:16:20,766
Redemption.

472
01:17:03,484 --> 01:17:06,912
Hey, what's that?

473
01:17:18,499 --> 01:17:21,728
I remember something like that.

474
01:17:32,681 --> 01:17:35,342
Help me!

475
01:17:37,385 --> 01:17:40,155
Help me!

476
01:17:42,656 --> 01:17:45,325
Help me, please!

477
01:17:46,193 --> 01:17:48,374
That's bait.

478
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:49,961
Stay in the rig.

479
01:17:55,336 --> 01:17:59,084
Hurry! Please, hurry! They'll be back!

480
01:17:59,741 --> 01:18:02,777
I am one of the Vuvalini!

481
01:18:02,877 --> 01:18:05,547
Of the Many Mothers!

482
01:18:06,347 --> 01:18:09,951
My initiate mother was K.T. Concannon!

483
01:18:10,651 --> 01:18:13,213
I am the daughter of Mary Jabassa.

484
01:18:14,455 --> 01:18:18,344
My clan was Swaddle Dog!

485
01:19:04,604 --> 01:19:05,784
It's me.

486
01:19:14,048 --> 01:19:16,083
There's something in the eyes.

487
01:19:16,183 --> 01:19:18,618
Perhaps it is Jabassa's child.

488
01:19:23,591 --> 01:19:26,284
This is our Furiosa.

489
01:19:27,862 --> 01:19:29,051
How long has it been?

490
01:19:30,896 --> 01:19:35,637
7,000 days.
Plus the ones I don't remember.

491
01:19:36,371 --> 01:19:38,540
Furiosa.

492
01:19:38,806 --> 01:19:41,836
What happened to your mother?

493
01:19:41,936 --> 01:19:43,778
She died.

494
01:19:44,178 --> 01:19:46,505
On the third day.

495
01:19:52,787 --> 01:19:56,657
- From where did you come?
- The west. Citadel.

496
01:19:56,757 --> 01:19:59,051
Beyond the mountains.

497
01:20:02,429 --> 01:20:04,732
The men... who are they?

498
01:20:04,832 --> 01:20:08,794
They're reliable.
They helped us get here.

499
01:20:20,115 --> 01:20:23,178
Where did you find such creatures?

500
01:20:24,819 --> 01:20:26,788
So soft.

501
01:20:26,888 --> 01:20:29,750
This one has all her teeth.

502
01:20:37,397 --> 01:20:40,034
I can't wait for them to see it.

503
01:20:40,134 --> 01:20:42,103
See?

504
01:20:42,203 --> 01:20:45,931
- See what?
- Home.

505
01:20:49,210 --> 01:20:50,879
The Green Place.

506
01:20:50,979 --> 01:20:56,531
But if you came from the west,
you passed it.

507
01:20:56,931 --> 01:21:01,753
The crows. The creepy place
with all the crows.

508
01:21:02,353 --> 01:21:03,825
- The soil.
- We had to get out.

509
01:21:03,925 --> 01:21:05,694
- We had no water and...
- The water was filth.

510
01:21:05,794 --> 01:21:09,330
- It was poisoned. It was sour.
- And the crows came.

511
01:21:09,430 --> 01:21:11,366
We couldn't grow anything.

512
01:21:11,466 --> 01:21:14,035
- Where are the others?
- What others?

513
01:21:14,135 --> 01:21:17,597
- The Many Mothers.
- We're the only ones left.

514
01:22:18,065 --> 01:22:19,955
Look.

515
01:22:21,868 --> 01:22:24,838
That's what you call a satellite.

516
01:22:24,938 --> 01:22:27,108
Miss Giddy told us about those.

517
01:22:27,708 --> 01:22:31,146
They used to bounce messages
across the earth.

518
01:22:31,246 --> 01:22:35,361
Shows. Everyone
in the old world had a show.

519
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:40,688
Do you think there's still
somebody out there?

520
01:22:41,288 --> 01:22:45,559
- Sending shows?
- Who knows.

521
01:22:45,659 --> 01:22:48,696
Those are the plains of silence.

522
01:22:50,596 --> 01:22:55,136
Stay right where you are, little Joe.
Kind of lost its novelty out here.

523
01:22:55,236 --> 01:22:57,038
You having a baby?

524
01:22:57,938 --> 01:23:00,645
Warlord Jr. Gonna be so ugly.

525
01:23:01,442 --> 01:23:04,010
It could be a girl.

526
01:23:04,910 --> 01:23:08,949
- You kill people with that, do ya?
- Killed everyone I ever met out here.

527
01:23:09,049 --> 01:23:11,619
Headshots, all of 'em.
Snap. Right in the medulla.

528
01:23:11,719 --> 01:23:14,779
Thought somehow you girls
were above all that.

529
01:23:18,158 --> 01:23:20,118
Come here.

530
01:23:27,267 --> 01:23:28,902
Take a peek.

531
01:23:29,002 --> 01:23:31,039
Seeds.

532
01:23:31,239 --> 01:23:35,076
These are from home.
Heirlooms. The real thing.

533
01:23:35,776 --> 01:23:38,780
- I plant one every chance I get.
- Where?

534
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:42,683
So far, nothing's took.
Earth's too sour.

535
01:23:42,783 --> 01:23:47,521
- So many different kinds.
- Trees, flowers, fruit.

536
01:23:47,621 --> 01:23:49,591
Back then, everyone had their fill.

537
01:23:50,491 --> 01:23:53,885
Back then, there was no need
to snap anybody.

538
01:24:08,475 --> 01:24:10,768
Can I talk to you?

539
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:32,157
I've talked with the others.

540
01:24:38,038 --> 01:24:42,271
We're never gonna have a better chance
to make it across the salt.

541
01:24:43,177 --> 01:24:47,628
If we leave the rig here and load
the motorcycles up with as much as we can,

542
01:24:47,728 --> 01:24:51,084
we can maybe ride for 160 days.

543
01:24:52,883 --> 01:24:55,923
One of those bikes is yours.

544
01:24:56,023 --> 01:24:58,560
Fully loaded.

545
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:03,234
You're more than welcome
to come with us.

546
01:25:06,767 --> 01:25:09,613
I'll... I'll make my own way.

547
01:25:15,209 --> 01:25:18,420
You know, hope is a mistake.

548
01:25:24,218 --> 01:25:27,679
If you can't fix
what's broken, you'll...

549
01:25:29,457 --> 01:25:31,916
you'll go insane.

550
01:25:47,107 --> 01:25:50,134
<i>Where are you, Max?</i>

551
01:25:50,978 --> 01:25:53,474
<i>Where are you?</i>

552
01:25:53,574 --> 01:25:56,442
- <i>Help us.</i>
- <i>You promised to help us.</i>

553
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:09,601
<i>Come on, pa. Let's go.</i>

554
01:26:40,527 --> 01:26:42,572
All right.

555
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:45,866
This is your way home.

556
01:26:48,602 --> 01:26:50,770
We go back?

557
01:26:51,872 --> 01:26:53,874
- Back?
- Yeah.

558
01:26:53,974 --> 01:26:57,244
- I thought you weren't insane anymore.
- What are they saying?

559
01:26:57,344 --> 01:26:59,747
He wants to go back
from where they came.

560
01:26:59,847 --> 01:27:01,982
The Citadel.

561
01:27:02,082 --> 01:27:04,028
And what's there to find at The Citadel?

562
01:27:04,128 --> 01:27:06,821
- Green.
- And water.

563
01:27:08,221 --> 01:27:11,993
There's a ridiculous amount
of clear water. And a lot of crops.

564
01:27:12,093 --> 01:27:14,662
It's got everything you need,
as long as you're not afraid of heights.

565
01:27:14,762 --> 01:27:17,499
- Where does the water come from?
- He pumps it up from deep in the earth.

566
01:27:17,599 --> 01:27:19,934
Calls it Aqua Cola
and claims it all for himself.

567
01:27:20,334 --> 01:27:22,470
And because he owns it,
he owns all of us.

568
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:24,105
I don't like him already.

569
01:27:24,205 --> 01:27:26,674
It'll take two weeks
to skirt the wall of mountains.

570
01:27:26,774 --> 01:27:31,729
No. I suggest we go back
the same way we came.

571
01:27:32,246 --> 01:27:34,748
Through the canyon.

572
01:27:34,848 --> 01:27:38,519
It's open. We know that. Right?
He brought all his war parties through.

573
01:27:39,219 --> 01:27:42,690
So we take the war rig and we charge it
right through the middle of them.

574
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:45,726
We can decouple the tanker at the pass.

575
01:27:45,826 --> 01:27:48,529
- Shut it off behind us.
- Kaboom!

576
01:27:51,464 --> 01:27:56,204
And how exactly do we take The Citadel?
Assuming we're still alive by then?

577
01:27:56,704 --> 01:27:59,140
If we can block the pass, it'll be easy.

578
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:03,044
All that's left are his war pups
and War Boys too sick to fight.

579
01:28:03,944 --> 01:28:07,454
And we'll be with Nux. He's a War Boy.

580
01:28:07,554 --> 01:28:10,242
He'll be bringing us home, bringing back
what's stolen, as he's meant to.

581
01:28:13,887 --> 01:28:15,856
Yeah.

582
01:28:15,956 --> 01:28:17,983
It feels like hope.

583
01:28:18,792 --> 01:28:22,496
I like this plan. We can start again.

584
01:28:22,596 --> 01:28:25,362
Just like the old days.

585
01:28:25,833 --> 01:28:29,637
Look, it'll be a hard day.

586
01:28:29,937 --> 01:28:32,840
But I guarantee you
that 160 days ridin' that way,

587
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:37,251
there's nothin' but salt.

588
01:28:39,944 --> 01:28:43,651
At least that way,
you know, we might be able to...

589
01:28:44,251 --> 01:28:46,287
together...

590
01:28:47,087 --> 01:28:48,948
Come across some kind of redemption.

591
01:29:19,748 --> 01:29:23,302
War rig! That's the war rig!

592
01:29:33,234 --> 01:29:36,037
- That's them.
- Why are they going back?

593
01:29:36,437 --> 01:29:38,954
Do they wish to surrender?

594
01:29:39,054 --> 01:29:42,099
They are heading for the canyon.

595
01:29:42,243 --> 01:29:45,379
They're going back to The Citadel!

596
01:29:45,479 --> 01:29:49,016
- They know it's undefended!
- Bullocks!

597
01:30:01,228 --> 01:30:02,488
Go!

598
01:30:24,918 --> 01:30:26,620
- What are you doing?
- Praying.

599
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:29,848
- To who?
- Anyone that's listening.

600
01:30:53,747 --> 01:30:56,412
Here we go, girls!

601
01:30:57,251 --> 01:30:59,078
That's mine!

602
01:31:02,990 --> 01:31:05,718
He'll try to get in front of us,
spike our wheels.

603
01:31:12,266 --> 01:31:13,934
Don't blow my engine.

604
01:31:14,034 --> 01:31:16,828
I'm gonna nudge him. Just a little.

605
01:31:29,182 --> 01:31:32,044
You filth! You traitored him!

606
01:31:56,011 --> 01:31:57,871
Go.

607
01:32:23,367 --> 01:32:27,641
Got to back off. Engine one is gone.
Two's about to blow.

608
01:32:27,741 --> 01:32:29,342
Right.

609
01:32:29,442 --> 01:32:31,145
Are you a black thumb?

610
01:32:31,245 --> 01:32:34,415
All right. Engine one now.
You and me, fifth wheel.

611
01:32:35,115 --> 01:32:37,610
We'll unhook the tanker.

612
01:32:48,862 --> 01:32:51,548
One man, one bullet.

613
01:33:07,514 --> 01:33:09,216
- I cannot see.
- Maadi! Maadi!

614
01:33:09,316 --> 01:33:11,609
I cannot see.

615
01:33:50,090 --> 01:33:54,819
Hey! Harpoons and plows!
They're hauling us back!

616
01:34:05,672 --> 01:34:08,600
Leave three bolts. Three.

617
01:35:26,086 --> 01:35:28,121
Hey, you!

618
01:35:43,069 --> 01:35:45,438
Are you okay?

619
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:49,801
I think she's hurt.

620
01:36:12,632 --> 01:36:13,703
Hey!

621
01:36:39,593 --> 01:36:41,286
No!

622
01:36:50,444 --> 01:36:53,440
<i>Hey. Stay with me.</i>

623
01:36:53,540 --> 01:36:55,309
- <i>Stay with me.</i>
- Stay with me.

624
01:36:55,409 --> 01:36:56,968
Hey. Are you there?

625
01:36:58,179 --> 01:37:00,839
You finish that! I'll finish her!

626
01:38:30,637 --> 01:38:32,530
Valhalla!

627
01:38:43,850 --> 01:38:44,985
Oi!

628
01:39:12,712 --> 01:39:16,273
Engine one's good. For now.

629
01:40:03,647 --> 01:40:06,505
She's hurt! She's hurt real bad!

630
01:41:36,789 --> 01:41:40,093
You hear that?
We're gonna see two airborne V-8s.

631
01:41:41,593 --> 01:41:44,230
I'm gonna need you to drive.

632
01:41:45,465 --> 01:41:47,678
I'll get him out of our way.

633
01:42:54,301 --> 01:42:56,551
Rictus!

634
01:42:56,651 --> 01:42:58,828
Take me!

635
01:43:11,017 --> 01:43:13,945
Cheedo! What are you doing?

636
01:43:18,191 --> 01:43:19,683
No!

637
01:43:23,897 --> 01:43:25,912
Big boy!

638
01:43:31,521 --> 01:43:33,431
Here! Here!

639
01:44:25,325 --> 01:44:26,769
No!

640
01:44:27,327 --> 01:44:29,187
Remember me?

641
01:44:49,938 --> 01:44:52,877
He's dead! He's dead.

642
01:45:11,771 --> 01:45:15,475
When you're across safe,
I'll jam the throttle and follow you.

643
01:45:15,575 --> 01:45:16,595
Come on!

644
01:45:17,808 --> 01:45:21,426
Hurry! We're nearly at the pass.

645
01:46:07,927 --> 01:46:10,521
Witness me.

646
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:18,458
Rictus!

647
01:47:12,625 --> 01:47:16,862
- Why is she making that noise?
- She's pumping air into her chest cavity.

648
01:47:16,962 --> 01:47:20,992
She's collapsing her lungs
one breath at a time.

649
01:47:26,472 --> 01:47:28,298
I know.

650
01:47:30,610 --> 01:47:33,138
I am so sorry.

651
01:47:34,851 --> 01:47:37,125
I know. I know.

652
01:47:37,225 --> 01:47:39,385
Hold it there.

653
01:47:39,485 --> 01:47:40,987
All right.

654
01:47:41,087 --> 01:47:43,589
Put that on there. Press it on.

655
01:47:43,689 --> 01:47:47,351
- Hey. Hey.
- Home.

656
01:47:54,667 --> 01:47:56,927
Home.

657
01:48:01,707 --> 01:48:03,334
No. No, no, no. No, no, no, no.

658
01:48:03,434 --> 01:48:06,009
She's exsanguinated.
Drained all her blood.

659
01:48:07,750 --> 01:48:09,510
Hold these.

660
01:48:09,610 --> 01:48:12,686
We need that. Thank you. Needle.

661
01:48:13,686 --> 01:48:15,568
Come on!

662
01:48:16,041 --> 01:48:18,061
Take this.

663
01:48:19,944 --> 01:48:21,336
Keep her awake.

664
01:48:21,436 --> 01:48:22,587
Furiosa.

665
01:48:26,399 --> 01:48:29,102
Okay, that's not retracting.

666
01:48:29,202 --> 01:48:31,370
There we go.

667
01:48:31,470 --> 01:48:34,355
All right, hold it up. Hold it up.

668
01:48:34,740 --> 01:48:36,388
Okay.

669
01:48:36,488 --> 01:48:38,533
Sorry.

670
01:48:39,345 --> 01:48:42,306
There you go. Okay. There you go.

671
01:48:54,427 --> 01:48:55,695
Max.

672
01:48:56,984 --> 01:48:59,489
My name is Max.

673
01:49:07,139 --> 01:49:09,666
That's my name.

674
01:49:50,683 --> 01:49:52,640
Brake!

675
01:49:57,256 --> 01:49:59,841
Reveal yourself.

676
01:50:17,427 --> 01:50:18,769
He's got something.

677
01:50:25,519 --> 01:50:27,105
It's Immortan Joe.

678
01:50:27,205 --> 01:50:30,178
The Immortan Joe is dead!

679
01:50:56,282 --> 01:50:58,451
Furiosa!

680
01:51:02,688 --> 01:51:03,857
Furiosa!

681
01:51:04,257 --> 01:51:06,693
She's back.

682
01:51:16,299 --> 01:51:18,729
Let's do it! Let 'em up. Come on.
