1
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:24,279
We've become bored with watching
actors give us phoney emotions.

2
00:00:24,549 --> 00:00:28,453
We're tired of pyrotechnics
and special effects.

3
00:00:28,723 --> 00:00:34,365
While the world he inhabits is,
in some respects, counterfeit. -

4
00:00:34,574 --> 00:00:38,036
- There's nothing fake
about Truman himself.

5
00:00:38,148 --> 00:00:41,132
No scripts, no cue cards.

6
00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:47,205
It isn't always Shakespeare,
but it's genuine. It's a life.

7
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:55,824
I'm not gonna make it. You're
gonna have to go on without me.

8
00:01:00,876 --> 00:01:02,878
No way, mister.

9
00:01:03,371 --> 00:01:07,372
You're going to the top of
this mountain, broken legs and all.

10
00:01:11,809 --> 00:01:15,012
Many viewers
leave him on all night, for comfort.

11
00:01:16,746 --> 00:01:19,506
You're crazy, you know that?

12
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:26,532
For me there's no difference between
private life and public life.

13
00:01:26,749 --> 00:01:32,123
My life is The Truman Show.
The Truman Show is a lifestyle.

14
00:01:32,338 --> 00:01:38,957
It's a noble life.
It is... a truly blessed life.

15
00:01:39,276 --> 00:01:41,632
Tell me something I don't know.

16
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:45,783
All right.
Promise me one thing, though.

17
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:53,141
If I die before the summit, use me
as an alternative source of food.

18
00:01:53,885 --> 00:01:55,927
You're gross.

19
00:01:59,158 --> 00:02:01,279
It's all real.

20
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:06,784
Nothing you see on the show is fake.
It's merely controlled.

21
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:13,745
THE TRUMAN SHOW

22
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:18,794
Eat me, dammit. That's an order.

23
00:02:21,038 --> 00:02:23,303
Maybe just your love handles.

24
00:02:23,932 --> 00:02:27,747
I have love handles?
Yeah, little ones.

25
00:02:27,894 --> 00:02:32,684
- Truman, you're gonna be late.
- Okay!

26
00:02:43,365 --> 00:02:45,618
DAY 10,909

27
00:02:46,978 --> 00:02:49,761
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

28
00:02:49,963 --> 00:02:54,958
And in case I don't see you,
good afternoon and good night.

29
00:02:56,507 --> 00:03:00,340
- Morning, Truman.
- Morning, Spencer. Hey, Pluto.

30
00:03:00,553 --> 00:03:04,966
- He won't hurt you.
- I know. It's just me.

31
00:03:05,183 --> 00:03:07,888
Come on, Pluto.

32
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,740
What is it?

33
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:55,890
An aircraft began shedding parts
as it flew over Sea haven -

34
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,060
- A few moments ago.
Luckily, no one was hurt.

35
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:03,484
How do you feel today...?
That's good.

36
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:06,951
- Thinking of flying somewhere?
- Nope.

37
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:12,074
This is classical Klyne.
Forget about the perils of flying -

38
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:15,627
- And let this music calm you down.

39
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:22,886
"Dog Fancy', please.
Thank you very much.

40
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:28,140
Get me a paper, will you, Errol?

41
00:04:28,364 --> 00:04:32,263
And one of these for the wife.
Loves her fashion mags.

42
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,810
- That be all for you, Truman?
- That's the whole kit and caboodle.

43
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,908
- Hank!
- Good morning, Truman.

44
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:55,545
Good morning, Truman.
Beautiful day, isn't it?

45
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:59,206
- Hows your lovely wife?
- Good. Yours?

46
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:02,342
Couldn't be better.

47
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:07,096
- Nice talking to you.
- You too. Think about that policy.

48
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:11,520
Two for one. That's a good deal.
Doppelganger special.

49
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,232
Hey, fellas.
Going in? Go ahead.

50
00:05:19,445 --> 00:05:24,155
- Go ahead.
- I'm not that anxious to get there.

51
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,965
Could I have directory assistance
for Fiji, please? Fiji Islands.

52
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:47,180
Truman, did you see this?

53
00:05:48,016 --> 00:05:52,844
I'm sorry, ma'am. If he's in a coma
he's probably uninsurable.

54
00:05:54,648 --> 00:05:58,977
Yes, Fiji. Do you have a listing
for Lauren Garland?

55
00:06:00,946 --> 00:06:03,235
Nothing listed...

56
00:06:03,448 --> 00:06:08,739
Do you have a Sylvia Garland?
S for Sylvia.

57
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:14,368
Nothing...
Okay, thank you.

58
00:06:50,413 --> 00:06:56,119
- Lawrence.
- I've got a prospect in Wells Park.

59
00:06:58,046 --> 00:07:03,253
Wells Park?
On... Harbour Island?

60
00:07:03,468 --> 00:07:08,889
- You know another one?
- I can't. I have an appointment.

61
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:11,341
Dentist, or... yeah.

62
00:07:11,768 --> 00:07:16,644
You'll lose more than your teeth
if you don't meet your quota.

63
00:07:16,857 --> 00:07:21,400
They're making cutbacks
at the end of this month.

64
00:07:21,612 --> 00:07:27,816
You need this. Besides, a half hour
across the bay will do you good.

65
00:07:28,995 --> 00:07:30,394
Thanks.

66
00:07:39,713 --> 00:07:44,589
Hello. Ferry's still here, huh?
Thought I might have missed it.

67
00:07:44,802 --> 00:07:48,930
- One way or return?
- Return.

68
00:07:51,058 --> 00:07:54,427
There you go, sir.

69
00:08:50,244 --> 00:08:55,451
- Do you need any help, sir?
- You go ahead, I'll be fine.

70
00:09:10,515 --> 00:09:12,515
Hi, honey.

71
00:09:13,268 --> 00:09:18,143
Look what I got free at
the checkout. It's a "Chef's Pal".

72
00:09:18,356 --> 00:09:23,267
It's a dicer, grater, peeler, all in
one. No sharpening, dishwater-safe.

73
00:09:23,486 --> 00:09:27,235
Wow... that's amazing.

74
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:32,905
Truman... you missed a spot.

75
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:50,010
That is a beer.

76
00:09:51,306 --> 00:09:55,767
- I'm thinking about getting out.
- Yeah? Out of what?

77
00:09:55,978 --> 00:10:00,189
Out of my job. Out of Sea haven.
Off this island. Out.

78
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:06,069
What the hell's wrong with your job?
You've got a great job. A desk job.

79
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,649
I'd kill for a desk job.

80
00:10:11,202 --> 00:10:17,454
You should try stocking vending
machines. Now there's excitement.

81
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:23,006
- Don't you ever get antsy?
- Where's there to go?

82
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:30,341
- Fiji.
- Where's Fiji? Near Florida?

83
00:10:36,227 --> 00:10:40,521
See here? This is us...

84
00:10:40,731 --> 00:10:45,358
And all the way
around here... Fiji.

85
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:50,362
You can't get any further away
before you start coming back.

86
00:10:50,575 --> 00:10:56,863
There's still islands in Fiji where
no human being has ever set foot.

87
00:10:57,832 --> 00:11:02,044
So when are you gonna go?

88
00:11:02,254 --> 00:11:05,374
It's not that simple.

89
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:09,671
It takes money, planning...

90
00:11:09,887 --> 00:11:14,679
- You can't just up and go.
- Right.

91
00:11:14,892 --> 00:11:18,557
I'm gonna do it,
don't worry about that.

92
00:11:18,771 --> 00:11:23,647
Bonus time
is just around the corner.

93
00:11:25,987 --> 00:11:29,687
- Are you coming for a drink?
- No, I can't tonight.

94
00:11:48,801 --> 00:11:53,843
I don't like that weather, son.
We should head back.

95
00:11:54,056 --> 00:11:57,141
Just a bit farther. Please?

96
00:11:57,352 --> 00:12:00,306
- Okay.
- Yes!

97
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,390
Daddy!

98
00:13:17,934 --> 00:13:21,054
You're soaked.
Where have you been?

99
00:13:21,271 --> 00:13:25,518
- We can scrape together 8,000...
- You and Marlon...

100
00:13:25,734 --> 00:13:30,610
- We can bum around the world.
- And then what?

101
00:13:30,823 --> 00:13:35,532
- You're talking like a teenager.
- Maybe I feel like a teenager.

102
00:13:35,744 --> 00:13:42,707
We have mortgage payments. Do we
just walk away from our obligations?

103
00:13:42,917 --> 00:13:47,959
- It would be an adventure.
- We were going to try for a baby.

104
00:13:48,173 --> 00:13:52,467
- Isn't that enough of an adventure?
- That can wait.

105
00:13:52,678 --> 00:13:57,553
I want to get away.
See some of the world. Explore!

106
00:13:57,766 --> 00:14:01,349
You want to be an explorer...

107
00:14:01,562 --> 00:14:06,354
This will pass.
We all think like this now and then.

108
00:14:08,611 --> 00:14:14,281
Let's get you out
of these wet clothes. Come to bed.

109
00:14:14,492 --> 00:14:21,242
You never see anything. They always
turn the camera and play music.

110
00:14:21,457 --> 00:14:25,621
The wind blows, the curtain moves.
You don't see anything.

111
00:14:30,425 --> 00:14:34,755
"Dog Fancy', please.
Thank you.

112
00:14:37,307 --> 00:14:40,141
Paper, Earl, please.

113
00:14:40,351 --> 00:14:43,436
I might as well get one of these.

114
00:14:43,646 --> 00:14:47,395
- For the wife?
- She's got to have them.

115
00:14:47,609 --> 00:14:52,187
- Anything else, Truman?
- That's the whole ball of wax.

116
00:15:13,969 --> 00:15:14,969
Dad?

117
00:15:17,723 --> 00:15:21,139
Hey, what are you doing?

118
00:15:22,395 --> 00:15:25,645
Get out of the way!

119
00:15:27,442 --> 00:15:32,020
Stop those people!
Stop! Stop!

120
00:15:32,238 --> 00:15:37,031
Open the door! Somebody
stop the bus! Stop the bus!

121
00:15:37,243 --> 00:15:42,403
Somebody stop it!
Stop the bus!

122
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,938
It doesn't sound insane at all.

123
00:16:07,148 --> 00:16:10,767
I see him ten times a week.

124
00:16:10,986 --> 00:16:14,900
I almost hugged a perfect stranger
in the salon...

125
00:16:15,115 --> 00:16:18,698
It was Dad.
Dressed like a homeless man.

126
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:25,364
And a businessman and a lady
with a dog forced him onto a bus.

127
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:30,827
It's about time they cleaned up
the trash downtown.

128
00:16:31,048 --> 00:16:34,464
They never found Dad's body.

129
00:16:34,677 --> 00:16:41,012
If it wasn't him, it was his twin!
Did Dad have a brother?

130
00:16:41,226 --> 00:16:46,385
You know perfectly well
that your father was an only child.

131
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:49,405
Just like you.

132
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:57,606
Sweetie... You're just feeling bad
because of what happened.

133
00:16:57,825 --> 00:17:00,945
You sailing off into that storm...

134
00:17:03,206 --> 00:17:08,580
But I've never blamed you.
And I don't blame you now.

135
00:17:55,676 --> 00:17:57,676
Truman...?

136
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:04,424
What are you doing down here?

137
00:18:04,643 --> 00:18:07,894
Fixing the mower.

138
00:18:10,024 --> 00:18:15,101
- I saw my father today.
- I know.

139
00:18:15,321 --> 00:18:18,441
Your mother called.

140
00:18:18,658 --> 00:18:21,445
You shouldn't upset her like that.

141
00:18:21,661 --> 00:18:26,738
- What did you want?
- I made macaroni.

142
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:30,125
- I'm not hungry.
- You know...

143
00:18:30,337 --> 00:18:33,788
We ought to throw out that mower.

144
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:38,586
Get one of those new Elk Rotaries.

145
00:19:13,089 --> 00:19:15,247
What's he doing?

146
00:19:15,466 --> 00:19:19,795
They got rid of her,
but they couldn't erase the memory.

147
00:19:20,012 --> 00:19:23,298
10,910
NUMBER OF DAYS RUNNING

148
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:17,899
- Are you okay?
- Excuse me. Sorry I fell on you.

149
00:20:18,113 --> 00:20:23,784
I've been such a klutz all day.
I must have sprained this ankle.

150
00:20:23,994 --> 00:20:28,953
- I'm so sorry to fall on you.
- Don't worry about it.

151
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:33,627
- I'm Meryl.
- Hi, I'm Truman.

152
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:03,462
- Truman, you've studied enough.
- I've got to commit this to memory.

153
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,048
Come on, an ice-cold brew sky.

154
00:22:07,266 --> 00:22:11,181
You're gonna have to copy off me,
so be careful.

155
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:15,346
You're a better person than I am.

156
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:18,686
- See you later.
- Bye.

157
00:22:18,903 --> 00:22:21,774
See you later, loser.

158
00:23:21,426 --> 00:23:22,426
Hi.

159
00:23:26,764 --> 00:23:29,931
- Konnichi-wa.
- What?

160
00:23:30,143 --> 00:23:34,852
- You take Japanese.
- Oh, yes...

161
00:23:37,651 --> 00:23:40,142
Lauren, right?

162
00:23:40,362 --> 00:23:44,609
- It's on the...
- Lauren, right.

163
00:23:44,825 --> 00:23:50,246
- I'm Truman Burbank.
- Yeah, I know.

164
00:23:50,456 --> 00:23:55,450
- I'm not allowed to talk to you.
- Really?

165
00:23:57,629 --> 00:24:03,134
- I'm a pretty dangerous character.
- I'm sorry. It's not up to me.

166
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,097
Girls have got to be careful.

167
00:24:09,308 --> 00:24:12,843
- You have a boyfriend, right?
- It's not that.

168
00:24:13,062 --> 00:24:18,187
Was it Meryl, the girl I was with?
We're not... We're just friends.

169
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,445
- It's nothing like that.
- It's how I look? Not your type?

170
00:24:24,282 --> 00:24:25,282
No.

171
00:24:27,118 --> 00:24:29,075
HOW'S IT GOING TO END?

172
00:24:29,287 --> 00:24:32,952
I was wondering that myself.

173
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:39,418
Would you maybe, possibly
sometime go out for some pizza?

174
00:24:39,631 --> 00:24:43,581
- Like, Friday? Saturday?
- I can't.

175
00:24:43,802 --> 00:24:46,471
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday?

176
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,680
NOW

177
00:24:50,225 --> 00:24:54,056
- We have finals tomorrow.
- Yeah, I know.

178
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:59,265
If we don't go now,
it won't happen. Do you understand?

179
00:24:59,484 --> 00:25:03,102
So what do you want to do?

180
00:25:35,646 --> 00:25:38,850
Please keep your hands
inside the car!

181
00:25:55,666 --> 00:26:01,586
This is my favorite pizza place.
Tony, one large, extra plankton!

182
00:26:01,797 --> 00:26:06,045
We have so little time.
They'll be here any minute.

183
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:11,302
- They don't want me talking to you.
- Then don't talk.

184
00:26:24,905 --> 00:26:27,305
They're here.

185
00:26:27,783 --> 00:26:31,697
- What do they want?
- Listen to me.

186
00:26:31,912 --> 00:26:37,203
Everybody knows everything you do.
They're pretending. Understand?

187
00:26:37,418 --> 00:26:43,088
- My name's not Lauren, it's Sylvia.
- Lauren, sweetheart, not again.

188
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:46,419
- Who are you?
- Her father.

189
00:26:46,636 --> 00:26:50,847
I've never seen him before.
Truman, don't listen to him.

190
00:26:51,057 --> 00:26:54,758
Everything I've told you
is the truth.

191
00:26:54,978 --> 00:27:00,268
It's fake. It's all for you. The sky
and the sea. Everything is a set!

192
00:27:00,482 --> 00:27:05,559
Please, don't listen to him.
He's gonna lie to you.

193
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:10,607
- I want to know what's going on.
- Schizophrenia. We've tried it all.

194
00:27:10,826 --> 00:27:16,450
Hypnotism, shock therapy...
Don't worry, you're not the first.

195
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:21,458
- She brings all her boys down here.
- Truman, he's lying!

196
00:27:21,671 --> 00:27:24,458
Get out of here. Come and find me.

197
00:27:24,674 --> 00:27:29,585
- I'll see you in school.
- We're moving to Fiji.

198
00:27:40,983 --> 00:27:43,022
Sylvia! Hey!

199
00:27:52,995 --> 00:27:58,071
- Why didn't he just follow her?
- His mother got really sick.

200
00:27:58,291 --> 00:28:02,538
He couldn't leave her.
He's kind. Maybe he's too kind.

201
00:28:02,754 --> 00:28:06,799
I can't believe he married Meryl
on the rebound.

202
00:28:07,009 --> 00:28:12,348
Come on, Sal. We've already got this
on the greatest hits tape.

203
00:28:24,318 --> 00:28:28,718
HOW'S IT GOING TO END?

204
00:28:59,479 --> 00:29:03,346
Close, but no cigar.

205
00:29:30,344 --> 00:29:35,339
Another beautiful day in paradise.
But don't forget to buckle up.

206
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:04,872
He's heading west on Stuart.
Stand by, all extras.

207
00:30:05,088 --> 00:30:08,671
He's turning onto Lancaster Square.

208
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:16,591
My God, he nearly hither! Something
is wrong. Change frequencies.

209
00:30:20,896 --> 00:30:27,645
Sorry about that, folks. I guess
we picked up a police frequency.

210
00:30:27,861 --> 00:30:33,698
It's classical Klyne, and we've
still got some great music ahead.

211
00:30:33,909 --> 00:30:39,152
But buckle up. Remember safety.
A good driver is a safe driver.

212
00:30:41,709 --> 00:30:44,959
CRACKDOWN ON HOMELESS
City Fathers: "Enough is Enough"

213
00:33:43,436 --> 00:33:47,730
- Can I help?
- I have an appointment.

214
00:33:53,697 --> 00:33:56,698
- What's happening?
- Nothing.

215
00:33:56,909 --> 00:34:00,823
- Just tell me what's happening.
- We're remodeling.

216
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:04,787
- It's none of your business.
- Tell me, or I'll report you!

217
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,787
You're trespassing.

218
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:42,283
- Marlon!
- Truman, what are you doing here?

219
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:47,788
I've got to talk to you.
I'm on to something big!

220
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:51,870
- You look like shit.
- I think I'm mixed up in something.

221
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:56,669
A lot of strange things
have been happening.

222
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:05,686
The people on the elevator,
there was no backing on it...

223
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:11,768
And the radio starts following me,
talking about everything I'm doing.

224
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:16,694
- This is one of your fantasies.
- I think this is about my dad.

225
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:22,577
I think he's alive. I'll tell you
about it later. I'm being followed.

226
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:23,787
Who?

227
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:29,742
It's hard to tell.
They look like regular people.

228
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:37,005
- How about those two?
- Could be.

229
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:42,759
It's when I'm unpredictable.
That's when they can't...

230
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:46,843
Anything happen...?
We have to get out of here.

231
00:35:47,063 --> 00:35:50,183
- You ready to go?
- I can't.

232
00:35:55,196 --> 00:36:00,191
- You're gonna get us both fired.
- Okay then, let's do it.

233
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:07,196
Whatever you say, I'm game.
Your birthday comes but once a year!

234
00:36:10,503 --> 00:36:13,031
Maybe I'm being set up
for something.

235
00:36:13,881 --> 00:36:18,508
You ever think that your whole life
has been building toward something?

236
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:19,719
No.

237
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:27,353
When you were hauling chickens,
how far did you get off the island?

238
00:36:27,562 --> 00:36:32,105
I went all over. Never found
a place like this, though.

239
00:36:32,317 --> 00:36:36,149
Look at that sunset. It's perfect.

240
00:36:36,363 --> 00:36:42,615
That's the big guy.
Quite a paintbrush he's got.

241
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:51,451
Just between you and me, Marlon...

242
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:56,546
- I'm going away for a while.
- Really?

243
00:37:07,478 --> 00:37:12,638
My little clown...
Old carrot-top.

244
00:37:14,109 --> 00:37:17,709
The best photos...

245
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,907
- We should be getting you home.
- Here's us at Mt. Rushmore.

246
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:29,572
Do you remember, Truman?
You slept the whole way there.

247
00:37:29,792 --> 00:37:34,501
- It looks so small.
- Things do, when you look back.

248
00:37:34,714 --> 00:37:39,210
Look, Truman.
The happiest day of our lives.

249
00:37:39,427 --> 00:37:44,303
- Look! Jean, Jodie, Joanne...
- Doesn't she look beautiful?

250
00:37:44,516 --> 00:37:48,430
Well, she still does.

251
00:37:48,645 --> 00:37:55,229
There's room for baby photos. I want
to hold a grandchild before I go.

252
00:37:55,444 --> 00:37:59,656
We really should get you home.
No, you stay. Relax.

253
00:37:59,865 --> 00:38:05,536
- Your favorite show is coming on.
- And we have something to discuss.

254
00:38:05,746 --> 00:38:10,373
- A certain person's birthday.
- Oh, I see.

255
00:38:10,585 --> 00:38:17,203
There'll be another "Lucy" tomorrow.
Now it's time for Golden Oldies.

256
00:38:17,424 --> 00:38:22,300
Tonight we present the classic:
"Show Me the Way to Go Home".

257
00:38:22,513 --> 00:38:28,136
You don't have to leave home to
discover what the world is about.

258
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:32,302
We learn that no one is poor
who has friends.

259
00:38:32,523 --> 00:38:39,736
Full of laughter, love, pain,
sadness, but ultimately, redemption.

260
00:38:39,947 --> 00:38:47,030
The cherry scene will have you
split ting your sides with laughter.

261
00:38:47,247 --> 00:38:52,039
There'll be tears, too, when
David and Jennifer are reunited.

262
00:38:52,252 --> 00:38:56,416
Let's join the Abbots
in Camden Village.

263
00:39:23,533 --> 00:39:26,107
Thank you, Sweetie.

264
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:33,084
I need to talk to you,
but let's go outside.

265
00:39:33,293 --> 00:39:38,419
- I'd love to, but I'm really late.
- What's your rush?

266
00:39:38,632 --> 00:39:43,211
There was that elevator disaster.
It was on the news.

267
00:39:43,429 --> 00:39:49,053
The cable just snapped.
The elevator plummeted ten flights.

268
00:39:49,268 --> 00:39:54,855
Right next door to where you work.
What if you had been in there?

269
00:39:55,066 --> 00:40:00,309
Anyway, I have an amputation on
one of the women from the elevator.

270
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:04,860
She's very young. It's sad.
Wish me luck.

271
00:40:05,076 --> 00:40:09,205
I'll cross my fingers for you.

272
00:40:49,955 --> 00:40:53,241
Excuse me. May I help you?

273
00:40:53,459 --> 00:40:57,872
I'm looking for my wife,
Nurse Burbank. It's very important.

274
00:40:58,089 --> 00:41:01,540
That's not possible.
She's in pre-op.

275
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:07,762
Sure... Okay, fine.
Can you pass along a message?

276
00:41:07,974 --> 00:41:11,639
I had to go to Fiji.
I'll call when I get there.

277
00:41:11,853 --> 00:41:15,187
- When you get to Fiji?
- You got it.

278
00:41:15,398 --> 00:41:18,767
- Fine. I'll tell her.
- Thank you so much.

279
00:41:45,554 --> 00:41:46,754
Sorry.

280
00:41:48,974 --> 00:41:51,845
Let me help you with that.

281
00:41:55,773 --> 00:41:57,773
He's here.

282
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,920
Scalpel.

283
00:42:09,328 --> 00:42:13,457
I'm now making
my primary incision. -

284
00:42:13,666 --> 00:42:17,248
- Just above the right knee.

285
00:42:21,465 --> 00:42:25,415
- Nicely done.
- Unless you're family...

286
00:42:25,636 --> 00:42:32,303
- It's just a beautiful job.
- I'll let someone else tidy up.

287
00:42:35,104 --> 00:42:37,891
TRAVELLERS BEWARE

288
00:42:48,702 --> 00:42:52,913
IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU!

289
00:42:58,128 --> 00:43:02,921
- I'm sorry to keep you.
- That's okay.

290
00:43:03,133 --> 00:43:08,294
- How can I help?
- I'd like a flight to Fiji.

291
00:43:08,514 --> 00:43:12,642
- When would you like to leave?
- Today.

292
00:43:30,619 --> 00:43:35,328
I'm sorry. I don't have anything
for at least a month.

293
00:43:35,541 --> 00:43:39,373
It's the busy season.

294
00:43:39,587 --> 00:43:42,671
Do you want to book the flight?

295
00:43:42,882 --> 00:43:46,132
I'll make other arrangements.

296
00:43:49,305 --> 00:43:54,382
Last call for Chicago!
All aboard!

297
00:44:00,233 --> 00:44:02,233
Thank you.

298
00:44:04,738 --> 00:44:08,237
Windy City, here we come.

299
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:09,450
Hi!

300
00:44:13,247 --> 00:44:14,847
Hello...

301
00:44:17,001 --> 00:44:22,207
- Mom, isn't that you know you?
- Face the front.

302
00:44:49,325 --> 00:44:52,575
Everybody off, we've got a problem.

303
00:45:11,431 --> 00:45:14,431
I'm sorry, son.

304
00:45:26,821 --> 00:45:33,025
- Wasn't his father from Chicago?
- His father was from Des Moines.

305
00:45:33,244 --> 00:45:39,532
- Why does he want to go to Chicago?
- He's not going anywhere.

306
00:45:56,602 --> 00:45:58,002
Truman?

307
00:46:02,984 --> 00:46:06,104
- Honey, are you okay?
- Get in.

308
00:46:10,074 --> 00:46:13,408
- Truman...
- Look.

309
00:46:19,626 --> 00:46:26,043
I predict that, in just a moment,
we'll see a lady on a red bike -

310
00:46:26,257 --> 00:46:31,797
- Followed by a man with flowers and
a Volkswagen with a dented fender.

311
00:46:32,013 --> 00:46:35,180
- Truman, please...
- Look!

312
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:41,630
Lady...

313
00:46:42,816 --> 00:46:44,816
Flowers...

314
00:46:45,277 --> 00:46:47,565
- And...?
- And...

315
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:55,329
- Truman, this is silly.
- There's the dented Beetle! Yes!

316
00:47:02,628 --> 00:47:06,840
You know how I did that?
They're on a loop.

317
00:47:07,049 --> 00:47:12,589
They go around the block, they
come back, they go around again.

318
00:47:12,805 --> 00:47:17,301
- I invited Marlon to barbecue...
- I won't be here.

319
00:47:17,518 --> 00:47:20,092
We need more charcoal.

320
00:47:20,313 --> 00:47:24,939
Are you listening
to a word I'm saying?

321
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:28,899
You're upset
because you want to go to Fiji?

322
00:47:30,072 --> 00:47:31,872
Okay, go.

323
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:39,329
I think you should save
for a few months, and then go.

324
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:42,245
I'm going to take a shower.

325
00:47:46,256 --> 00:47:49,375
Let's go now.
I'm ready. Why wait?

326
00:47:49,592 --> 00:47:54,385
Early bird gathers no moss,
rolling stone catches the worm.

327
00:47:54,598 --> 00:47:58,346
Truman, what are you doing?

328
00:48:01,938 --> 00:48:07,146
- Truman...
- Where shall we go?

329
00:48:08,487 --> 00:48:13,149
- Truman, where are we going?
- I guess I'm being spontaneous.

330
00:48:13,367 --> 00:48:17,863
Somebody help me!
I'm being spontaneous!

331
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:23,038
Forget Fiji.
We can't drive to Fiji, can we?

332
00:48:24,295 --> 00:48:28,873
- What about Atlantic City.
- No, you hate to gamble.

333
00:48:29,091 --> 00:48:33,254
That's right, I do.
But I never have.

334
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:36,507
And that's why people go places.

335
00:48:36,724 --> 00:48:40,768
- I think I'm going to throw up.
- Me, too.

336
00:48:49,278 --> 00:48:54,237
Blocked at every turn. Beautifully
synchronized, don't you think?

337
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:58,744
- You're blaming me for the traffic?
- Should I?

338
00:49:04,419 --> 00:49:08,417
Truman, let's go home.

339
00:49:08,632 --> 00:49:12,215
You're right.
We could be stuck here for hours.

340
00:49:12,427 --> 00:49:17,255
It'll be like this all the way
to Atlantic City. Let's go back.

341
00:49:17,474 --> 00:49:21,602
I'm sorry.
I don't know what got into me.

342
00:49:23,564 --> 00:49:28,024
- Can you please slow down?
- Yes, I can.

343
00:49:30,153 --> 00:49:33,356
- That's our turn-off.
- I changed my mind.

344
00:49:33,573 --> 00:49:37,903
What's New Orleans like
this time of year? Mardis Gras!

345
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:49,170
Look, Meryl. Same road, no cars.
It's magic.

346
00:49:49,381 --> 00:49:54,458
Let me out. If you want to
destroy yourself, do it on your own.

347
00:49:54,678 --> 00:49:58,723
I think I'd like a little company.

348
00:50:03,479 --> 00:50:08,272
Oh, Truman...
You knew this would happen.

349
00:50:08,484 --> 00:50:11,770
You know you can't drive over water.

350
00:50:11,988 --> 00:50:16,033
Let's go home,
where you'll feel safe.

351
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:20,612
Give me your hand...
You drive!

352
00:50:21,957 --> 00:50:26,619
We shouldn't be doing this.
We're breaking the law!

353
00:50:26,837 --> 00:50:31,379
- Oh, my!
- You can do it! You can make it!

354
00:50:32,926 --> 00:50:36,875
We're over! We're over the bridge!

355
00:50:37,097 --> 00:50:40,929
- We're over the bridge!
- We're over!

356
00:50:44,396 --> 00:50:46,519
FOREST FIRE WARNING
EXTREME DANGER

357
00:50:46,732 --> 00:50:50,564
- What about that sign?
- They exaggerate. We'll be fine.

358
00:50:52,446 --> 00:50:55,316
Do you believe that?

359
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:00,779
Truman, we're on fire!

360
00:51:00,996 --> 00:51:04,496
- It's just smoke. You okay?
- Yes.

361
00:51:04,709 --> 00:51:07,793
- Wanna do it again?
- No!

362
00:51:08,004 --> 00:51:10,604
Truman, stop!

363
00:51:13,019 --> 00:51:16,318
What do we do for money
when we get to New Orleans?

364
00:51:17,805 --> 00:51:20,842
I have my Sea haven bank card.

365
00:51:21,059 --> 00:51:25,270
So we're just going to
eat into our savings, is that it?

366
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:30,818
I'll have to call your mother.
I don't know how she'll take this.

367
00:51:43,414 --> 00:51:45,214
What now?

368
00:51:45,583 --> 00:51:48,074
SEAHAVEN
NUCLEAR POWER STATION

369
00:51:51,506 --> 00:51:54,958
- Looks like a leak at the plant.
- Back up.

370
00:51:55,177 --> 00:52:01,891
Leak at the plant.
The whole area is being evacuated.

371
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:06,229
- Thank you for your help.
- You're welcome, Truman.

372
00:52:06,438 --> 00:52:08,238
Truman...

373
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:14,110
Truman, come back!

374
00:52:17,074 --> 00:52:18,874
Stop him!

375
00:52:19,827 --> 00:52:21,227
Truman!

376
00:52:40,097 --> 00:52:42,097
Stay away!

377
00:52:57,782 --> 00:53:03,453
- Thank you both for your help.
- Next time he'll be charged.

378
00:53:03,663 --> 00:53:08,409
I understand.
Thanks again. Good night.

379
00:53:26,395 --> 00:53:31,141
Let me get you some help, Truman.
You're not well.

380
00:53:33,652 --> 00:53:38,812
Why do you want to have a baby
with me? You can't stand me.

381
00:53:39,032 --> 00:53:42,069
That's not true.

382
00:53:45,915 --> 00:53:51,668
I'll fix you some Mococoa. Natural
cocoa beans from Mt. Nicaragua.

383
00:53:51,879 --> 00:53:58,000
- No artificial sweeteners.
- What are you talking about?

384
00:53:58,219 --> 00:54:01,837
I've tasted other cocoas.
This is the best.

385
00:54:02,056 --> 00:54:06,350
What the hell does this
have to do with anything?

386
00:54:06,561 --> 00:54:11,307
- Tell me what's happening!
- You're having a nervous breakdown.

387
00:54:11,524 --> 00:54:14,395
You're part of this, aren't you?

388
00:54:16,696 --> 00:54:21,489
Truman, you are scaring me.

389
00:54:21,702 --> 00:54:25,486
No, you're scaring me.
What are you gonna do?

390
00:54:25,706 --> 00:54:30,167
Dice me, slice me or peel me?
There's so many choices.

391
00:54:31,962 --> 00:54:34,561
Do something!

392
00:54:35,215 --> 00:54:38,999
What? What did you say?

393
00:54:39,219 --> 00:54:42,968
- Who are you talking to?
- I didn't say anything.

394
00:54:43,181 --> 00:54:48,223
- I wasn't talking to anybody.
- Talk to me!

395
00:54:48,437 --> 00:54:53,182
- I don't know anything!
- Stay where you are.

396
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,400
Truman...?

397
00:54:58,614 --> 00:55:00,614
Thank God!

398
00:55:05,162 --> 00:55:10,240
How can anyone expect me to
carry on under these conditions?

399
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:13,247
It's unprofessional!

400
00:55:17,133 --> 00:55:21,131
Everything's gonna be okay.
It's all gonna be fine.

401
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:29,514
I don't know what to think, Marlon.

402
00:55:31,481 --> 00:55:35,526
Maybe I'm losing my mind.

403
00:55:37,779 --> 00:55:42,690
It feels like the whole world
revolves around me.

404
00:55:42,909 --> 00:55:47,203
That's a lot of world for one man.

405
00:55:48,456 --> 00:55:54,495
Is it wishful thinking? Wishing
you'd made more out of yourself?

406
00:55:54,713 --> 00:56:01,511
Who hasn't sat in the john and
had an imaginary interview on TV?

407
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:07,260
This is different.
Everybody seems to be in on it.

408
00:56:09,061 --> 00:56:13,189
I've been your best friend
since we were seven.

409
00:56:13,399 --> 00:56:18,738
We got through school by cheating
off each others test papers.

410
00:56:18,946 --> 00:56:22,814
Jesus, they were identical.

411
00:56:23,034 --> 00:56:26,485
But I always felt safe knowing that.

412
00:56:26,704 --> 00:56:31,699
Because whatever the answer was,
we were right or wrong together.

413
00:56:33,336 --> 00:56:39,125
I stayed up all night in your tent
so you could play North Pole.

414
00:56:39,342 --> 00:56:42,508
And I got pneumonia.

415
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,962
Remember that?

416
00:56:45,181 --> 00:56:47,850
You were out of school for a month.

417
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:59,361
You're the closest thing I ever had
to a brother, Truman.

418
00:57:03,325 --> 00:57:09,778
Things haven't worked out for us
like we used to dream they would.

419
00:57:11,583 --> 00:57:16,044
I know what that feeling's like.
Everything slipping away...

420
00:57:16,255 --> 00:57:20,668
You don't want to believe it, so you
look for answers somewhere else.

421
00:57:27,517 --> 00:57:33,970
But the point is, I'd gladly
walk in front of traffic for you.

422
00:57:38,944 --> 00:57:43,820
But the point's, I'd gladly
step in front of traffic for you.

423
00:57:44,033 --> 00:57:47,366
And the last thing I'd ever do
is lie to you.

424
00:57:49,664 --> 00:57:56,331
And the last thing that
I would ever do... is lie to you.

425
00:57:59,632 --> 00:58:02,799
I mean, think about it.

426
00:58:03,011 --> 00:58:08,467
If everybody is in on it...
I'd have to be in on it, too.

427
00:58:17,693 --> 00:58:22,485
I'm not in on it, Truman,
because there is no "it".

428
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:30,954
- You were right about one thing.
- What's that?

429
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,832
The thing that started all this.

430
00:58:50,309 --> 00:58:55,932
I found him for you, Truman.
That's why I came by tonight.

431
00:58:56,148 --> 00:59:00,360
I'm sure he's got
quite a story to tell.

432
00:59:02,822 --> 00:59:04,822
Go to him.

433
00:59:10,413 --> 00:59:13,035
Easy on the fog.

434
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:18,544
Stand by, crane-cam...
Crane-cam.

435
00:59:26,346 --> 00:59:28,303
Button-cam three.

436
00:59:40,611 --> 00:59:43,528
I never stopped believing.

437
00:59:45,574 --> 00:59:48,859
Go wide. Curb-cam eight.

438
00:59:49,077 --> 00:59:50,477
My son.

439
00:59:51,997 --> 00:59:55,864
- Move in for close-up?
- No, no...

440
00:59:56,877 --> 00:59:59,878
Stay back.
Fade up music.

441
01:00:06,137 --> 01:00:09,671
Now go for the close-up.

442
01:00:09,890 --> 01:00:14,220
All those years wasted.
I'll make it up to you, son.

443
01:00:15,229 --> 01:00:16,829
I swear.

444
01:00:22,821 --> 01:00:24,021
Dad...

445
01:00:36,043 --> 01:00:37,243
Bravo!

446
01:00:38,253 --> 01:00:41,254
Congratulations.

447
01:00:41,465 --> 01:00:46,209
- Okay, quiet down. Concentrate.
- That was great television.

448
01:00:52,058 --> 01:00:56,186
- Christ of, it was brilliant!
- It broke my heart.

449
01:00:59,024 --> 01:01:01,894
Well done! Congratulations!

450
01:01:10,077 --> 01:01:13,244
Truman drinks Mococoa,
world's finest cocoa beans -

451
01:01:13,455 --> 01:01:16,410
- Grown on the upper slopes
of Mt. Nicaragua.

452
01:01:20,004 --> 01:01:24,084
1. 7 billion were there
for his birth.

453
01:01:27,178 --> 01:01:30,345
220 countries tuned in
for his first step.

454
01:01:30,557 --> 01:01:34,685
The world stood still
for that stolen kiss.

455
01:01:34,894 --> 01:01:39,058
And as he grew, so did the
technology. A human life. -

456
01:01:39,274 --> 01:01:44,315
- Recorded on a network of
hidden cameras and broadcast live -

457
01:01:44,528 --> 01:01:49,903
- 24 hours a day, seven days a week,
to an audience around the globe.

458
01:01:50,117 --> 01:01:56,203
From Sea haven, enclosed in the
largest studio ever constructed. -

459
01:01:56,416 --> 01:02:02,454
- One of only two man-made
structures visible from space. -

460
01:02:02,672 --> 01:02:08,093
- Now in its 30th great year,
it's The Truman Show!

461
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:16,601
What a week! I was on
pins and needles the entire time.

462
01:02:16,812 --> 01:02:19,647
I'm your host, Mike Michelson.

463
01:02:19,857 --> 01:02:23,308
Welcome to True-Talk, our forum for
issues growing out of the show.

464
01:02:23,527 --> 01:02:26,979
Tonight, something very special:

465
01:02:27,198 --> 01:02:31,445
An exclusive interview
with the show's creator.

466
01:02:31,661 --> 01:02:38,458
Let's go live to the 221stfloor
of the Omni-Cam Ecosphere.

467
01:02:38,668 --> 01:02:42,369
There we'll find
the world's greatest tele-visionary.

468
01:02:42,589 --> 01:02:47,629
The designer of the world within
a world that's Sea haven: Christ of.

469
01:02:47,843 --> 01:02:52,885
I'd like to thank you
for granting this interview.

470
01:02:53,099 --> 01:02:58,555
We know your schedule is demanding,
and how you guard your privacy.

471
01:02:58,771 --> 01:03:02,816
- This, sir, is indeed an honor.
- Don't mention it.

472
01:03:03,025 --> 01:03:06,442
The catalyst
for the recent dramatic events -

473
01:03:06,821 --> 01:03:11,567
- Has been Truman's father, Kirk,
and his attempt at in filtration.

474
01:03:11,785 --> 01:03:16,992
This is not the first time someone
has tried to reach Truman, is it?

475
01:03:17,207 --> 01:03:20,493
We have had our close calls.

476
01:03:20,711 --> 01:03:27,378
It's television!
I did it! I'm on The Truman Show!

477
01:03:27,593 --> 01:03:35,008
But now, the first intruder
to be a former cast member.

478
01:03:35,226 --> 01:03:40,351
- A dead one at that.
- Writing Kirk back in, brilliant.

479
01:03:40,564 --> 01:03:46,270
Kirk started this whole crisis. He
was the only one who could end it.

480
01:03:46,487 --> 01:03:48,686
Truman, no!

481
01:03:49,323 --> 01:03:52,988
- That's off limits!
- Why? What's over there?

482
01:03:53,202 --> 01:03:57,662
Nothing. It's dangerous, that's all.
You have to know your limitations.

483
01:03:57,873 --> 01:04:02,037
Let's remind viewers why Dad was
written outin' the first place.

484
01:04:02,253 --> 01:04:07,211
As Truman grew up, we manufactured
ways to keep him on the island.

485
01:04:07,425 --> 01:04:14,222
- I'd like to be a great explorer.
- There's nothing left to explore.

486
01:04:18,978 --> 01:04:24,684
- Then I thought up Kirk's drowning.
- He's feared the water ever since.

487
01:04:24,901 --> 01:04:31,568
When Kirk read the synopsis, he was
disappointed, to say the least.

488
01:04:31,783 --> 01:04:35,034
I'm sure
that's why he broke onto the set.

489
01:04:35,245 --> 01:04:39,788
But how do you intend to explain
his 22-year absence?

490
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,705
- Amnesia.
- Brilliant.

491
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:49,123
Let's take some viewer calls. North
Carolina, you're on with Christ of.

492
01:04:49,342 --> 01:04:54,585
Hi, Christ of. I was wondering how
many cameras you got in that town.

493
01:04:54,806 --> 01:04:59,303
Somewhere in the vicinity of5,000.

494
01:04:59,519 --> 01:05:03,564
Remember, we started with just one.

495
01:05:03,774 --> 01:05:10,192
He was two weeks premature, as if
he couldn't wait to get started.

496
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:15,447
And his eagerness to leave the womb
was the reason he was selected.

497
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:19,529
In competition with five other
unwanted pregnancies -

498
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:25,455
- For a show determined by an air
date, only Truman arrived on cue.

499
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:33,087
I believe Truman is the first child
to be adopted by a corporation.

500
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:37,349
- That's correct.
- The show's made enormous revenue.

501
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:40,726
Equivalent to the GNP
of a small country.

502
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:45,231
It takes the population of an
entire country to keep it running.

503
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:52,358
Since it's on 24 hours, revenues are
generated by product placement.

504
01:05:52,573 --> 01:05:57,568
Everything on the show is for sale,
down to the very homes they live in.

505
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:01,915
All of tin the Truman catalogue.
Operators are standing by.

506
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:07,712
Christ of, why has Truman
never come close to discovering -

507
01:06:07,923 --> 01:06:11,671
- The true nature of his world
until now?

508
01:06:11,885 --> 01:06:15,883
We accept the reality of the world
with which we're presented.

509
01:06:17,099 --> 01:06:21,428
The Hague for Christ of. Hello.
The Hague...

510
01:06:22,730 --> 01:06:26,313
All right,
let's go to Hollywood, California.

511
01:06:26,525 --> 01:06:32,362
You're a liar and a manipulator, and
what you've done to Truman is sick.

512
01:06:32,573 --> 01:06:38,861
Well, we remember this voice,
don't we? How could we forget?

513
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:43,493
- Let's go to another call.
- No, no. It's fine, Mike.

514
01:06:43,710 --> 01:06:48,206
I love to reminisce
with former members of the cast.

515
01:06:48,423 --> 01:06:54,425
Sylvia, as you announced so
melodramatically to the world...

516
01:06:54,637 --> 01:06:59,216
Do you think because you batted
your eyes at Truman once. -

517
01:06:59,434 --> 01:07:03,681
- Flirted with him,
stole a few minutes of air time -

518
01:07:03,897 --> 01:07:08,191
- To thrust your politics into
the limelight, that you know him?

519
01:07:08,401 --> 01:07:13,313
That you know what's right for him?
Are you in a position to judge him?

520
01:07:13,532 --> 01:07:18,407
What right do you have to
turn a baby's life into a mockery?

521
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:22,665
Don't you ever feel guilty.

522
01:07:22,875 --> 01:07:27,869
I have given Truman
the chance to lead a normal life.

523
01:07:28,088 --> 01:07:32,038
The world, the place you live in. -

524
01:07:32,259 --> 01:07:37,681
- Is the sick place. Sea haven
is the way the world should be.

525
01:07:37,890 --> 01:07:43,098
- He's a prisoner, not a performer.
- He can leave at any time.

526
01:07:43,312 --> 01:07:48,438
If his was more than a vague
ambition, if he was determined -

527
01:07:48,651 --> 01:07:54,605
- To discover the truth, there's
no way we could prevent him.

528
01:07:54,823 --> 01:07:59,284
I think what distresses you,
really, caller. -

529
01:07:59,495 --> 01:08:05,368
- Is that, ultimately, Truman
prefers his cell, as you call it.

530
01:08:05,585 --> 01:08:10,875
That's where you're so wrong.
And he'll prove you wrong.

531
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:17,508
These heated comments aside, it's
been a very positive experience.

532
01:08:17,722 --> 01:08:21,637
For Truman and for the viewers.

533
01:08:21,851 --> 01:08:28,186
Thank you for your time.
Now that this crisis is behind us. -

534
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:32,694
- Can we look forward
to some exciting new developments?

535
01:08:32,905 --> 01:08:38,492
The big news is: Meryl will leave
Truman in an upcoming episode.

536
01:08:38,702 --> 01:08:41,822
A new romantic interest
will be introduced.

537
01:08:42,039 --> 01:08:46,582
I'm determined that TVs first
on-air conception will take place.

538
01:08:46,794 --> 01:08:49,830
Another television milestone.

539
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:56,583
It has been a singular honor
and a pleasure. Christ of, thank you.

540
01:10:14,591 --> 01:10:16,991
Hey, Simeon.

541
01:10:20,765 --> 01:10:25,806
- Is he looking at us?
- You think he knows?

542
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:29,555
- Hello...
- Better call Christ of.

543
01:10:29,774 --> 01:10:32,692
Come in, Major Burbank.

544
01:10:48,835 --> 01:10:52,667
He's back to his old self.

545
01:10:59,721 --> 01:11:03,469
That's an unusual cat, my man.

546
01:11:06,853 --> 01:11:11,017
I hereby proclaim this planet...

547
01:11:14,653 --> 01:11:18,152
...Trumania of the Burbank galaxy.

548
01:11:19,783 --> 01:11:23,911
- Is he gonna go?
- Hallway camera ready.

549
01:11:24,121 --> 01:11:29,791
- That one's for free.
- Stand by, all house cameras.

550
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:34,464
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

551
01:11:34,674 --> 01:11:39,550
- In case I don't see you...
...good afternoon and good night.

552
01:11:41,472 --> 01:11:46,633
Good afternoon, good night...

553
01:11:46,895 --> 01:11:53,348
- Morning, Truman. Hows it going?
- I'll check. Vital signs are good.

554
01:11:55,403 --> 01:11:57,603
Hey, Pluto!

555
01:11:58,073 --> 01:12:01,322
- Good morning!
- Look who's here.

556
01:12:01,534 --> 01:12:06,529
Beautiful day, isn't it? We thought
about the policy, and we'll take it.

557
01:12:06,748 --> 01:12:11,125
Great! Let's go up to my office
and sign the papers.

558
01:12:11,336 --> 01:12:15,914
- Next week would be better.
- I knew it. See you guys.

559
01:12:16,132 --> 01:12:19,964
- See you next week.
- Looking forward to it!

560
01:12:20,178 --> 01:12:24,425
This isn't about insurance.
This is about the great variable.

561
01:12:24,641 --> 01:12:30,015
When will death occur?
Could be a week, a month, a year...

562
01:12:30,230 --> 01:12:33,018
Could be today.

563
01:12:33,233 --> 01:12:39,237
Innocent sunbather, stabbed by
the tip of a runaway beach umbrella.

564
01:12:39,448 --> 01:12:42,698
No way to guard against that.

565
01:12:44,161 --> 01:12:47,946
- Excuse me.
- Truman, this is Vivian.

566
01:12:48,166 --> 01:12:51,665
The two of you
are going to be neighbors.

567
01:12:54,631 --> 01:13:00,170
I guess what I'm saying
is that life is... fragile.

568
01:13:01,887 --> 01:13:05,007
- Vivian, your office.
- Sorry.

569
01:13:05,224 --> 01:13:09,222
I'm sorry... You do?

570
01:13:09,437 --> 01:13:13,933
Oh, great.
Let me take your information.

571
01:13:29,207 --> 01:13:32,161
Ready, two. Go to two.

572
01:13:35,297 --> 01:13:40,339
Back to medium... and wide.

573
01:13:48,602 --> 01:13:53,063
I was just trying
to train the kid to... never mind.

574
01:13:56,277 --> 01:14:01,271
- What's he doing in the basement?
- He moved in there when Meryl left.

575
01:14:01,490 --> 01:14:06,615
Why wasn't I told? Unpredictable
behavior has to be reported.

576
01:14:06,829 --> 01:14:11,740
- He's just sleeping. I thought...
- This is the best shot we've got?

577
01:14:11,959 --> 01:14:15,791
- What's on the clock-cam?
- Obstruction.

578
01:14:16,005 --> 01:14:20,667
- What happened?
- He was tidying up his garbage.

579
01:14:20,885 --> 01:14:25,096
I was gonna call you,
but he gave up and fell asleep.

580
01:14:25,306 --> 01:14:30,597
- I want to check the set-ups...
...for the insurance convention.

581
01:14:30,812 --> 01:14:32,812
Nice move.

582
01:14:40,864 --> 01:14:43,464
There you go.

583
01:14:52,918 --> 01:14:57,379
Isolate the audio.
Give me a close-up on his torso.

584
01:15:00,509 --> 01:15:03,213
Still breathing.

585
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:09,463
Where's Chloe? Call him.
Tell him it's a wrong number.

586
01:15:12,938 --> 01:15:17,150
- What took you so long?
- I had to wait for it.

587
01:15:17,359 --> 01:15:23,445
- They were busy. What's going on?
- I don't know.

588
01:15:23,657 --> 01:15:28,569
- He did nothing but stand around.
- Shut up and watch.

589
01:15:28,788 --> 01:15:32,655
Then we went to night vision.
He's asleep.

590
01:15:34,502 --> 01:15:39,294
There! Stop it.
Zoom in under the chair.

591
01:15:42,510 --> 01:15:48,264
- Enhance it.
- Is it...? My God...

592
01:15:48,475 --> 01:15:55,522
- He didn't go up the stairs.
- Get Marlon over there!

593
01:16:11,081 --> 01:16:15,161
Truman... Surprise party!

594
01:16:16,336 --> 01:16:21,247
I got a six-pack of cold brew skies
with our name on them.

595
01:16:21,466 --> 01:16:25,001
Come on, pal.
Come on, buddy.

596
01:16:27,639 --> 01:16:28,639
Shit!

597
01:16:31,477 --> 01:16:35,771
Marlon, find him.
He's still in the room.

598
01:16:38,776 --> 01:16:42,608
- Come out, wherever you are.
- Good. Keep it light.

599
01:16:42,822 --> 01:16:45,147
I know you're in here.

600
01:16:49,287 --> 01:16:55,123
Check under the table.
The closet, behind you.

601
01:17:00,924 --> 01:17:05,218
Gee, I wonder where
he could possibly be.

602
01:17:13,144 --> 01:17:14,944
Lawn-cam!

603
01:17:22,737 --> 01:17:26,569
- Say something. Keep it going.
- He's gone.

604
01:17:26,783 --> 01:17:29,986
- Cut transmission!
- Cut transmission?

605
01:17:33,457 --> 01:17:38,617
- God in heaven!
- Give me the phone!

606
01:17:45,177 --> 01:17:48,297
TECHNICAL FAULT
PLEASE STAND BY

607
01:18:00,610 --> 01:18:06,897
We've got every available extra
looking for him. The crew, too.

608
01:18:07,116 --> 01:18:10,864
- What about prop cars?
- Accounted for.

609
01:18:11,078 --> 01:18:15,408
He has the world's most recognizable
face, he can't disappear.

610
01:18:54,832 --> 01:18:58,201
Go find him, Pluto. Good dog.

611
01:18:58,419 --> 01:19:03,081
All this fuss!
If he could just hear my voice.

612
01:19:03,299 --> 01:19:06,299
Truman! Truman!

613
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:11,587
Let me try.
Truman!

614
01:19:11,807 --> 01:19:16,807
It's me, Dad!
Let's talk!

615
01:19:19,023 --> 01:19:23,436
Yeah, I know. We're just about
done with the square.

616
01:19:23,652 --> 01:19:27,900
We've got to go back to Barrymore,
check the interiors.

617
01:19:28,115 --> 01:19:34,236
Who's watching the college?
Send someone over there.

618
01:19:39,502 --> 01:19:43,666
- Take another man, get down there.
- Find the son of a bitch!

619
01:19:43,882 --> 01:19:47,547
Get some batteries.
He's not gonna glow in the dark.

620
01:19:50,514 --> 01:19:54,891
We need more light.
We'll never find him this way.

621
01:19:59,314 --> 01:20:03,775
- What time is it?
- It's way too early for that.

622
01:20:09,783 --> 01:20:12,183
Cue the sun.

623
01:20:17,582 --> 01:20:20,038
What time is it?

624
01:20:20,252 --> 01:20:25,922
Christ of, what's going on?
There's rumors that he's dead.

625
01:20:26,133 --> 01:20:28,754
The media's having a feeding frenzy.

626
01:20:28,969 --> 01:20:34,723
Every network has a pirated shot
of Marlon making an ass of himself.

627
01:20:34,934 --> 01:20:40,355
- The sponsors are threatening us.
- We're getting our highest ratings.

628
01:20:44,485 --> 01:20:48,732
- No sign of him.
- Go back to town, join the others.

629
01:20:48,948 --> 01:20:55,034
Everyone else at first positions.
Everyone is at first positions?

630
01:21:12,555 --> 01:21:15,889
He's got to be there somewhere.

631
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:22,104
- We're not watching the sea.
- Why would we watch the sea?

632
01:21:22,315 --> 01:21:27,310
- Sweep the harbour.
- Bring up the harbour cameras.

633
01:21:27,529 --> 01:21:32,487
- Aren't some of those out?
- Yeah, but we have the lighthouse.

634
01:21:32,701 --> 01:21:36,533
All buoy-cams, please.

635
01:21:36,747 --> 01:21:40,827
- Long lens, short-base cameras.
- Why are we looking at the water?

636
01:21:45,923 --> 01:21:50,336
Truman, where are you going?

637
01:21:52,555 --> 01:21:58,225
- Sailing? He's afraid of the water.
- Resume transmission.

638
01:22:03,942 --> 01:22:07,192
I got 2-1 he doesn't make it.

639
01:22:11,575 --> 01:22:14,777
Just leave them in the car.

640
01:22:25,713 --> 01:22:30,541
Get off this mast-cam. You can't
see his face. Go to the cabin-cam.

641
01:22:33,221 --> 01:22:36,637
Perfect.
That's our hero shot.

642
01:23:02,794 --> 01:23:07,919
- Let's get another boat out there.
- I need to talk to the ferry guys.

643
01:23:08,132 --> 01:23:11,715
Come on, get it moving!

644
01:23:14,513 --> 01:23:19,424
- I'm just the bus driver.
- They can't sail. They're actors!

645
01:23:23,898 --> 01:23:26,815
How do we stop him?

646
01:23:36,202 --> 01:23:43,450
Okay... We're going to access
the weather programme' now.

647
01:23:43,668 --> 01:23:47,962
So hold on to your hats.
You got that?

648
01:23:48,173 --> 01:23:52,669
No, I think we'll want to
localize the storm over the boat.

649
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:57,588
Get the co-ordinates.

650
01:23:57,808 --> 01:24:03,562
- There's no rescue boat.
- He'll turn back. He'll be afraid.

651
01:24:05,524 --> 01:24:07,647
There she blows.

652
01:24:19,329 --> 01:24:20,929
Come on.

653
01:24:44,105 --> 01:24:46,775
Give me some lightning.

654
01:24:46,983 --> 01:24:49,355
Hit him again!

655
01:25:01,707 --> 01:25:08,041
- He can't die on television!
- He was born on television.

656
01:25:42,164 --> 01:25:43,764
Hold on!

657
01:26:09,693 --> 01:26:12,943
Is that the best you can do?

658
01:26:13,155 --> 01:26:16,191
You're gonna have to kill me!

659
01:26:17,368 --> 01:26:20,154
What should we do
with a drunken sailor...

660
01:26:20,370 --> 01:26:26,539
- I demand you cease transmission.
- Keep running.

661
01:26:26,751 --> 01:26:29,587
Increase the wind!

662
01:26:32,591 --> 01:26:36,920
- For the last time...
- Capsize him, tip him over.

663
01:26:37,137 --> 01:26:41,680
- He's tied himself to the boat!
- He'll drown, and he doesn't care.

664
01:26:41,842 --> 01:26:44,466
Do it... Do it!

665
01:27:38,842 --> 01:27:40,390
That's enough.

666
01:31:51,278 --> 01:31:52,804
I want to talk to him.

667
01:31:57,923 --> 01:31:58,923
EXIT

668
01:32:11,729 --> 01:32:15,810
Truman... You can speak.

669
01:32:17,986 --> 01:32:20,986
I can hear you.

670
01:32:23,950 --> 01:32:27,734
- Who are you?
- I'm the creator of a TV show.

671
01:32:27,954 --> 01:32:31,323
It gives hope
and inspiration to millions.

672
01:32:35,628 --> 01:32:39,412
- Then who am I?
- You're the star.

673
01:32:44,888 --> 01:32:49,431
- Was nothing real?
- You were real.

674
01:32:49,643 --> 01:32:53,890
That's what made you so good
to watch. Listen, Truman.

675
01:32:54,106 --> 01:33:00,061
There's no more truth out there
than in the world I created for you.

676
01:33:01,989 --> 01:33:06,984
The same lies, the same deceit.

677
01:33:07,203 --> 01:33:13,324
But in my world,
you have nothing to fear.

678
01:33:16,170 --> 01:33:21,165
- I know you better than you do.
- You never had a camera in my head.

679
01:33:22,218 --> 01:33:27,094
You're afraid.
That's why you can't leave.

680
01:33:31,602 --> 01:33:35,434
It's okay, Truman.
I understand.

681
01:33:37,024 --> 01:33:42,185
I have been watching you
your whole life.

682
01:33:42,405 --> 01:33:46,355
I was watching when you were born.

683
01:33:46,576 --> 01:33:50,325
I was watching
when you took your first step.

684
01:33:53,917 --> 01:33:58,912
I watched you
on your first day of school.

685
01:33:59,131 --> 01:34:03,543
The episode
when you lost your first tooth.

686
01:34:06,138 --> 01:34:08,843
You can't leave, Truman.

687
01:34:09,058 --> 01:34:12,261
- Please, God.
- You belong here.

688
01:34:12,478 --> 01:34:14,601
You can do it.

689
01:34:15,564 --> 01:34:17,164
With me.

690
01:34:19,568 --> 01:34:23,483
Talk to me.
Say something.

691
01:34:27,827 --> 01:34:34,161
Say something, damn it! You're
on TV. You're live to the world!

692
01:34:51,058 --> 01:34:56,682
In case I don't see you,
good afternoon and good night.

693
01:35:34,936 --> 01:35:38,388
He made it!
All right, Truman!

694
01:35:48,186 --> 01:35:50,542
Cease transmission.

695
01:35:55,124 --> 01:36:00,748
- You want another slice?
- No. Let's see what else is on.
