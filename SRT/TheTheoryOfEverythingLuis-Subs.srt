1
00:01:16,858 --> 00:01:18,659
Well, come on!

2
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:20,696
Come on, old man!

3
00:01:21,396 --> 00:01:23,431
Coming into Trinity Lane.

4
00:01:25,968 --> 00:01:27,308
Eyes on the road, Brian!

5
00:01:31,323 --> 00:01:33,136
Brian spies an opening!

6
00:01:34,442 --> 00:01:37,606
Eyes on the staff! Hawking's lost it!

7
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:44,572
No!

8
00:01:44,698 --> 00:01:46,308
You lose, Brian.

9
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,781
Too slow, old man. Too slow.

10
00:01:56,165 --> 00:01:58,479
- Oh, my goodness.
- Right.

11
00:01:58,679 --> 00:02:00,003
Time for a drink.

12
00:02:01,096 --> 00:02:02,171
Hello.

13
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,386
Oo-pah!

14
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:10,481
What if the secret of the universe
had something to do with sex?

15
00:02:10,581 --> 00:02:13,483
Maybe do your doctorate on that.
The physics of love.

16
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:16,253
- I think that's more your field, Brian.
- Oh, not lately.

17
00:02:16,353 --> 00:02:18,690
They will boot you out, you know,
if you don't decide.

18
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,443
I know everyone here who's...

19
00:02:21,743 --> 00:02:23,226
Brilliant.

20
00:02:23,426 --> 00:02:25,631
Oh, dear. Scientists.

21
00:02:26,331 --> 00:02:28,101
- Yes.
- You made it.

22
00:02:29,428 --> 00:02:32,709
Don't worry, we don't have to stay for long.
Looks mortifyingly dull.

23
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,746
- Bores.
- Who's that?

24
00:02:40,846 --> 00:02:42,081
Who's who?

25
00:02:42,381 --> 00:02:43,916
Oh, him?

26
00:02:44,616 --> 00:02:49,755
He's strange. Clever.
Goes to "Ban the Bomb" marches.

27
00:02:50,155 --> 00:02:53,894
Wilde. Jane Wilde.

28
00:02:53,994 --> 00:02:55,500
Oh, look, there's David. David!

29
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,279
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Diana! Diana!

30
00:03:14,515 --> 00:03:16,384
- Hello.
- Hello.

31
00:03:16,584 --> 00:03:18,820
- Science.
- Arts.

32
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,791
- English?
- French and Spanish.

33
00:03:23,491 --> 00:03:25,895
What about you? What are you...

34
00:03:25,995 --> 00:03:28,163
Oh, cosmologist, I'm a cosmologist.

35
00:03:28,563 --> 00:03:30,265
What's that?

36
00:03:30,565 --> 00:03:33,101
It's a kind of religion
for intelligent atheists.

37
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:35,035
Intelligent atheists?

38
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:38,946
- You're not religious, are you?
- C of E.

39
00:03:41,911 --> 00:03:43,940
- Church of England?
- England, yeah.

40
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:47,918
I suppose someone has to be.

41
00:03:48,718 --> 00:03:52,821
- What do cosmologists worship, then?
- What do we worship?

42
00:03:52,921 --> 00:03:56,960
One single unifying equation that explains
everything in the universe.

43
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,360
- Really?
- Yes.

44
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,473
What's the equation?

45
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,100
That is the question.

46
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,846
And a very good question.
I'm not quite sure yet.

47
00:04:08,104 --> 00:04:10,214
But I intend to find out.

48
00:04:17,115 --> 00:04:19,018
Then why didn't you stay at Oxford?

49
00:04:19,118 --> 00:04:21,620
Because my finals exams
were such a shambles,

50
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,890
that the examiners,
they summoned me in for a viva,

51
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,626
- and they told me that if I got a second...
- What's a viva?

52
00:04:28,026 --> 00:04:31,263
Oh, it's a sort of mildly terrifying
face-to-face thingy.

53
00:04:31,363 --> 00:04:33,733
- Like an interview?
- An interrogation.

54
00:04:34,133 --> 00:04:36,835
And I told them that if they
gave me a second-class degree,

55
00:04:36,935 --> 00:04:39,405
then I would stay with them
and do my research at Oxford.

56
00:04:39,505 --> 00:04:42,241
But if they gave me the first that
I needed to get into Cambridge,

57
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:45,111
then they would never
have to see me again.

58
00:04:46,211 --> 00:04:48,147
They gave you the first.

59
00:04:48,647 --> 00:04:50,983
- They gave me a first.
- Of course.

60
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:56,432
This party is officially deceased.
Come on, I fixed up a ride home.

61
00:04:57,591 --> 00:04:59,560
Come on, Jane.

62
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,229
Jane.

63
00:05:02,329 --> 00:05:04,857
Well, it was lovely to talk to you.

64
00:05:04,957 --> 00:05:06,065
Yes.

65
00:05:06,165 --> 00:05:09,456
And I hope you find your equation.

66
00:05:10,003 --> 00:05:11,867
Yes. Oh.

67
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,433
Bye.

68
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,247
Bye.

69
00:05:27,122 --> 00:05:28,720
- Stephen?
- Oh.

70
00:05:29,591 --> 00:05:30,466
Yeah.

71
00:05:39,367 --> 00:05:41,403
Well, then, here we are.

72
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:45,442
A little challenge for you all, as you embark
upon your separate doctoral journeys,

73
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:47,376
whatever they may be, Mr. Hawking.

74
00:05:48,278 --> 00:05:49,280
Pass them down.

75
00:05:50,192 --> 00:05:53,549
Something to separate the men
from the boys, the wheat from the chaff,

76
00:05:53,649 --> 00:05:57,420
the mesons from the pi mesons,
the quarks from the quacks.

77
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,425
Ten questions, each more
impregnable than the last.

78
00:06:01,525 --> 00:06:02,833
Good luck.

79
00:06:02,933 --> 00:06:05,724
You'll need it.
Shall we say Friday, 3:00?

80
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,308
This is going to hospitalize me.

81
00:06:11,768 --> 00:06:15,459
And, one. Drive! Two. Drive!

82
00:06:15,607 --> 00:06:17,475
Three. Drive!

83
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,312
- Stay long, Brian.
- I'll give you something long.

84
00:06:20,412 --> 00:06:24,315
Stay long, Brian! Keep long, Brian!

85
00:06:24,415 --> 00:06:25,583
Shut up!

86
00:06:25,683 --> 00:06:27,252
- Long, Brian!
- I'm exhausted!

87
00:06:27,352 --> 00:06:29,440
Stay long, Brian!

88
00:06:32,356 --> 00:06:34,394
Flip it. Flip it, Wiggs.

89
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:38,031
Somebody else, for once.

90
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,065
- Can I get two more of those, please?
- Yeah, sure.

91
00:06:40,165 --> 00:06:42,947
- And some change for the payphone.
- Yeah.

92
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,655
- Steve, you all right, mate?
- Jane.

93
00:07:00,867 --> 00:07:03,424
No, of course, Timothy turned out
to be an absolute cad.

94
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:06,795
I mean, you'll never guess who I saw
him with the other day. Caroline!

95
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:10,399
For heaven's sake,
she can have him, quite frankly.

96
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,201
What's the probability?

97
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,403
Reasonably low.

98
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:21,143
This is... This is Stephen.

99
00:07:21,243 --> 00:07:23,421
- Do you play croquet?
- Croquet?

100
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,147
Not recently.

101
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:28,050
Sunday morning.

102
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,654
Actually busy Sunday mornings.

103
00:07:35,156 --> 00:07:36,567
Him.

104
00:07:39,694 --> 00:07:41,098
Okay.

105
00:07:47,603 --> 00:07:51,452
Anyway, before I was
completely interrupted...

106
00:08:02,453 --> 00:08:04,368
Oh, come on, get up.

107
00:08:04,555 --> 00:08:06,530
How many did you get?

108
00:08:07,491 --> 00:08:10,929
- Morning, Brian.
- Good afternoon, Stephen.

109
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:12,763
How many of the
impossible questions did you do?

110
00:08:12,863 --> 00:08:15,146
Brian, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

111
00:08:15,246 --> 00:08:17,937
How many of Sciama's questions
did you get, Stephen?

112
00:08:18,037 --> 00:08:20,628
- None.
- You didn't get any?

113
00:08:20,961 --> 00:08:21,974
I was going to do them later.

114
00:08:22,074 --> 00:08:24,777
- You haven't even looked at them.
- No.

115
00:08:24,877 --> 00:08:28,217
Stephen, are you aware that you have
voluntarily embarked upon a PhD in physics,

116
00:08:28,317 --> 00:08:30,716
- at the most prestigious college in England?
- Yes.

117
00:08:30,816 --> 00:08:33,662
I thought maybe you'd slept through
the induction or something.

118
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:39,659
- Bri?
- What?

119
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:43,905
- Can you whip on some Wagner?
- Oh, sod off.

120
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,878
- Come in, Stephen.
- Sorry.

121
00:09:32,842 --> 00:09:35,938
Michael, that's so illegible,
I can't quite decipher how wrong it is.

122
00:09:36,038 --> 00:09:40,224
I suspect enormously.
And, Brian, that's just baffling.

123
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,864
- Have you even bothered, Stephen?
- Oh, sorry.

124
00:09:48,364 --> 00:09:51,101
Right. Train timetables.

125
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:56,706
That's totally unacceptable.
These expired a month ago.

126
00:09:56,806 --> 00:09:59,310
It's on the back,
I had a little accident.

127
00:10:05,917 --> 00:10:07,084
I could only do nine.

128
00:10:11,022 --> 00:10:12,007
Good Lord.

129
00:10:13,307 --> 00:10:15,385
Oh, thank God. Bravo.

130
00:10:17,462 --> 00:10:18,900
Nine?

131
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,070
Come in.

132
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,483
Stephen, take a seat.

133
00:10:39,352 --> 00:10:42,460
I wanted to talk to you
about your subject.

134
00:10:43,056 --> 00:10:46,660
We're all rather concerned
as to what it's going to be.

135
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,587
I can't decide.

136
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:54,771
Do you have any ideas?

137
00:10:56,771 --> 00:10:57,922
No.

138
00:11:16,023 --> 00:11:17,518
So,

139
00:11:17,965 --> 00:11:22,597
this is where J.J. Thomson
discovered the electron,

140
00:11:22,698 --> 00:11:26,071
and where Rutherford split the atom.

141
00:11:29,184 --> 00:11:32,141
You know, one of the great rewards
of this job is one never knows

142
00:11:32,241 --> 00:11:36,516
from where the next great leap forward
is going to come, or from whom.

143
00:11:40,217 --> 00:11:44,688
Listen, next Friday, I'm taking a
few graduates of merit to London

144
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:48,326
to attend a talk by the
mathematician Roger Penrose.

145
00:11:48,626 --> 00:11:51,565
Do come along, if you're interested.

146
00:11:55,765 --> 00:11:58,405
Oh, and close the door as you leave.

147
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:46,653
So, I gather you've
never been to church.

148
00:12:46,773 --> 00:12:50,458
- Once upon a time.
- Tempted to convert?

149
00:12:50,558 --> 00:12:53,781
I have a slight problem with the
whole "celestial dictator" premise.

150
00:12:54,696 --> 00:12:56,775
Now, what are you doing for lunch?

151
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,065
Ma makes a cracking roast.

152
00:13:04,071 --> 00:13:07,308
So, Jane, what are you studying?

153
00:13:07,408 --> 00:13:09,111
- Arts.
- Spuds?

154
00:13:09,211 --> 00:13:10,446
Thank you.

155
00:13:11,246 --> 00:13:14,717
French and Spanish.
I'm hoping to do a PhD eventually.

156
00:13:14,917 --> 00:13:16,285
Oh, what on?

157
00:13:16,385 --> 00:13:18,953
Medieval poetry
of the Iberian Peninsula.

158
00:13:19,053 --> 00:13:23,192
Medieval poets?
What painters do you like?

159
00:13:23,292 --> 00:13:25,344
Well, I like Turner.

160
00:13:25,744 --> 00:13:28,964
Turner, really? You know,
I always feel that his paintings

161
00:13:29,064 --> 00:13:31,345
look as if they've been
left out in the rain.

162
00:13:31,447 --> 00:13:32,823
Pa.

163
00:13:32,923 --> 00:13:34,571
And William Blake.

164
00:13:34,671 --> 00:13:36,439
- Thank you, Mother.
- Oh, good heavens, surely not.

165
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:39,096
- Jane, have some of my elderflower wine.
- Oh, yes, thank you.

166
00:13:39,196 --> 00:13:41,278
Don't touch it. Don't touch it, Jane.

167
00:13:41,378 --> 00:13:45,348
Thank you. Mother?
Stephen doesn't like my home-made wine.

168
00:13:45,448 --> 00:13:49,787
Philistine. I'm going to send you back
with a couple of bottles.

169
00:13:49,887 --> 00:13:53,590
So, Stephen, you have come
from church with a good woman.

170
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,268
Are you feeling holier than thou?

171
00:13:56,194 --> 00:13:58,929
Positively saintly. Thank you.

172
00:13:59,229 --> 00:14:01,533
You haven't said why
you don't believe in God.

173
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,702
A physicist can't allow his
calculations to be muddled

174
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,872
by a belief in a supernatural creator.

175
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:10,417
Sounds less of an argument
against God than against physicists.

176
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,448
Light or dark?

177
00:14:16,716 --> 00:14:20,028
- Jane, light meat or dark?
- Oh, light, please.

178
00:14:20,942 --> 00:14:23,121
I'm inviting Jane to be my
partner to the May Ball.

179
00:14:23,221 --> 00:14:24,857
Really?

180
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:28,893
- Very impressive.
- You'll have to dance this year, Stephen.

181
00:14:29,362 --> 00:14:31,850
Make way for Mother's leg. Here we go.

182
00:14:49,751 --> 00:14:51,188
Hello.

183
00:14:53,488 --> 00:14:54,860
Hello.

184
00:15:10,011 --> 00:15:10,738
Sorry.

185
00:15:10,838 --> 00:15:12,417
- You okay?
- Yeah.

186
00:15:21,918 --> 00:15:23,930
- Do you dance, Stephen?
- No.

187
00:15:25,654 --> 00:15:27,990
No. I don't dance.

188
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:32,028
It's a phenomenon I'm very happy to observe,
but I can't possibly imagine participating.

189
00:15:32,128 --> 00:15:34,530
I absolutely agree.
I mean, who would want to dance?

190
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,497
No, I'm serious. I don't dance.

191
00:15:39,971 --> 00:15:41,779
No dancing, then.

192
00:15:48,979 --> 00:15:52,149
You see how the men's shirtfronts
and their bow ties,

193
00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:54,150
how they glow more than
the women's dresses?

194
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,553
Yes.

195
00:15:55,753 --> 00:15:58,456
- Do you know why?
- Why?

196
00:15:59,156 --> 00:16:01,819
- Tide.
- The washing powder?

197
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,131
The fluorescence in the washing powder
is caught by the UV light.

198
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:08,900
Why do you know that?

199
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:15,957
When stars are born,

200
00:16:16,457 --> 00:16:18,578
and when... whe they die,

201
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:20,747
they emit UV radiation.

202
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:24,484
So if we could see the night sky
in the ultraviolet light,

203
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:27,925
then almost all the stars
would disappear

204
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,324
and all that we would see

205
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:33,962
are these spectacular births and deaths.

206
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:38,396
I reckon it would look a little...

207
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:40,378
Like that.

208
00:16:57,485 --> 00:16:58,986
Wow!

209
00:16:59,953 --> 00:17:01,856
Did you see?

210
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:04,700
Like those. Like those ones...

211
00:17:16,138 --> 00:17:18,673
- Why?
- Why what?

212
00:17:18,773 --> 00:17:20,476
Why Spanish medieval poetry?

213
00:17:20,576 --> 00:17:23,881
I suppose I like to time-travel.

214
00:17:24,581 --> 00:17:26,449
Like you.

215
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:29,686
Are there any particular time periods
that you like to visit?

216
00:17:29,786 --> 00:17:33,791
- I imagine the Twenties was fun.
- The Roaring Twenties.

217
00:17:33,991 --> 00:17:38,095
"Seek, then,
no learning from starry men,

218
00:17:38,195 --> 00:17:42,587
"who follow with the optic glass
the whirling ways of stars that pass."

219
00:17:47,071 --> 00:17:48,270
Bravo.

220
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:16,556
Well, that's astonishing, isn't it?

221
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,867
"In the beginning...

222
00:18:23,967 --> 00:18:28,062
"was the Heaven and the Earth.

223
00:18:30,117 --> 00:18:33,154
"And the Earth was without form,

224
00:18:34,654 --> 00:18:39,505
"and darkness was upon
the face of the deep."

225
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,177
Will you dance with me?

226
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:55,280
<i>The train now departing
from platform three</i>

227
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:59,916
<i>is the nine-seventeen service
to London King's Cross.</i>

228
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:10,355
Come on, Stephen. Get a move on.

229
00:20:10,455 --> 00:20:13,212
What's wrong with you, man? Chop-chop.

230
00:20:27,374 --> 00:20:31,078
A star, more than three times
the size of our sun,

231
00:20:31,178 --> 00:20:33,524
ought to end its life how?

232
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,419
With a collapse. The gravitational
forces of the entire mass

233
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:41,800
overcoming the electromagnetic
forces of individual atoms,

234
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,291
and so collapsing inwards.

235
00:20:44,391 --> 00:20:47,620
If the star is massive enough,
it will continue this collapse,

236
00:20:47,728 --> 00:20:49,498
creating a black hole,

237
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:53,902
where the warping of space-time is
so great that nothing can escape.

238
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:56,156
Not even light. It gets...

239
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,107
smaller.

240
00:21:00,108 --> 00:21:01,442
Smaller.

241
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:06,449
The star, in fact, gets denser,
as atoms, even subatomic particles,

242
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:10,987
get literally crushed into
smaller and smaller space.

243
00:21:12,287 --> 00:21:16,759
And at its end point,
what are we left with?

244
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:20,498
A space-time singularity.

245
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:24,945
Space and time come to a stop.

246
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:55,333
I wonder what would happen if you applied
Penrose's theory about black holes

247
00:21:55,433 --> 00:21:57,703
to the entire universe.

248
00:21:58,303 --> 00:22:01,206
If Einstein is right,
or if general relativity is correct,

249
00:22:01,306 --> 00:22:03,376
then the universe is expanding, yes?

250
00:22:03,476 --> 00:22:05,008
- Yes.
- Okay. So...

251
00:22:05,108 --> 00:22:08,380
If you reverse time,
then the universe is getting smaller.

252
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,392
- All right.
- So,

253
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:14,721
what if I reverse the process
all the way back,

254
00:22:14,821 --> 00:22:17,891
to see what happened at the
beginning of time itself?

255
00:22:17,991 --> 00:22:21,545
- At the beginning of time itself?
- Yes. So the universe,

256
00:22:21,645 --> 00:22:24,584
getting smaller and smaller,
getting denser and denser,

257
00:22:24,684 --> 00:22:27,667
- hotter and hotter as we...
- You mean wind back the clock?

258
00:22:27,968 --> 00:22:31,005
- Exactly. Wind back the clock.
- Wind back the clock.

259
00:22:31,105 --> 00:22:33,008
Is that what you're doing?

260
00:22:33,508 --> 00:22:35,910
- Are you winding back the clock?
- That is what I'm doing.

261
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:39,263
Well, keep winding.
And you've got quite a long way to go.

262
00:22:39,363 --> 00:22:41,215
- Keep winding.
- I don't want to fall in.

263
00:22:41,315 --> 00:22:42,483
You've got to get back
to the beginning of time.

264
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:44,954
You've got a long way to go.
Keep winding.

265
00:22:45,054 --> 00:22:48,158
Keep winding until you get...

266
00:22:49,403 --> 00:22:51,293
- A singularity?
- A space-time singularity.

267
00:22:51,393 --> 00:22:54,162
So, the universe born
from a black hole exploding.

268
00:22:54,262 --> 00:22:56,718
- Keep going.
- What do you mean, "Keep going"?

269
00:22:57,231 --> 00:22:58,768
Before the universe began?

270
00:22:58,868 --> 00:23:01,602
No, no, no, no. Keep going,
develop the mathematics.

271
00:24:45,648 --> 00:24:47,916
Okay, all right, very good.

272
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:50,987
Push it as hard as you can. Push it.

273
00:24:51,087 --> 00:24:54,488
- Push it. As hard as you can.
- I am pushing as hard as I can.

274
00:24:56,157 --> 00:25:00,195
Why... Come on. One, two...

275
00:25:02,699 --> 00:25:04,334
Why won't it...

276
00:25:04,934 --> 00:25:06,828
All right, all right.

277
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:10,536
Fourth finger, fourth peg.

278
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:47,888
It's called motor neuron disease.

279
00:25:51,649 --> 00:25:53,986
It's a progressive neurological disorder

280
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:58,425
that destroys the cells in the brain
that control essential muscle activity,

281
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:01,294
such as speaking,

282
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:03,228
walking...

283
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:06,790
breathing, swallowing.

284
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:12,006
The signals that muscles must receive
in order to move are disrupted.

285
00:26:12,806 --> 00:26:16,477
The result is gradual muscle decay.

286
00:26:17,377 --> 00:26:19,447
Wasting away.

287
00:26:20,647 --> 00:26:26,621
Eventually, the ability to control
voluntary movement is lost.

288
00:26:27,122 --> 00:26:28,760
Entirely.

289
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:36,402
I'm afraid average life expectancy
is two years.

290
00:26:40,502 --> 00:26:43,107
There's nothing I can do for you.

291
00:26:45,508 --> 00:26:47,545
What about the brain?

292
00:26:49,345 --> 00:26:53,812
The brain isn't affected.
Your thoughts won't change, it's...

293
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,786
just that...

294
00:26:58,186 --> 00:27:01,854
Well, eventually,
no one will know what they are.

295
00:27:04,927 --> 00:27:06,983
I'm ever so sorry.

296
00:27:33,156 --> 00:27:34,934
Hello, Brian.

297
00:27:57,216 --> 00:28:00,220
Welcome to this week's episode
of <i>The Natural World,</i>

298
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,458
where this week we explore the
bizarre hibernation patterns

299
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:06,873
of the rare Cambridge physicist

300
00:28:06,973 --> 00:28:10,433
seen here in his remarkable plumage.

301
00:28:12,533 --> 00:28:15,736
So how was it? What did they say?
How's your wrist?

302
00:28:16,136 --> 00:28:18,640
I have a disease, Bri.

303
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,369
Is it venereal, Stephen?

304
00:28:25,712 --> 00:28:27,951
I have motor neuron disease.

305
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:31,353
Sorry, I don't...

306
00:28:31,453 --> 00:28:34,255
It's Lou Gehrig's disease.
He was a baseball player.

307
00:28:34,355 --> 00:28:37,859
Sorry, I'm lagging behind in
my pioneering research into

308
00:28:37,959 --> 00:28:41,698
obscure, motor,
baseball-related diseases.

309
00:28:43,299 --> 00:28:45,888
I have two years to live.

310
00:28:46,669 --> 00:28:48,327
Sorry?

311
00:28:49,239 --> 00:28:52,123
It does sound odd when you
say it out loud, doesn't it?

312
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:57,200
You... What do you mean?

313
00:28:57,847 --> 00:28:59,779
No, you don't.

314
00:29:00,783 --> 00:29:04,891
What did they say?
Sorry, I don't really...

315
00:29:07,891 --> 00:29:09,060
Will you go, Bri?

316
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,710
Stephen, sorry, I was just
being a berk. I didn't...

317
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:13,164
No, it's not...

318
00:29:15,198 --> 00:29:16,632
Will you go?

319
00:29:17,701 --> 00:29:20,872
Stephen, phone for you.

320
00:29:20,972 --> 00:29:22,656
It's a girl.

321
00:29:32,449 --> 00:29:34,715
I'll... I'll...

322
00:29:35,587 --> 00:29:37,576
I'll see you soon. I'll...

323
00:29:38,156 --> 00:29:39,764
Yes.

324
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,807
She's waiting.

325
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:04,259
Stephen?

326
00:30:43,058 --> 00:30:45,295
Nobody's seen him for a while.

327
00:30:45,395 --> 00:30:47,334
I suppose, you know...

328
00:30:51,734 --> 00:30:53,635
Jane. Jane.

329
00:30:53,735 --> 00:30:56,741
Brian, hello. Sorry.

330
00:30:57,741 --> 00:31:00,248
Why don't you... Why don't you sit down?

331
00:31:05,348 --> 00:31:06,883
I'm so sorry.

332
00:31:06,983 --> 00:31:10,820
I spoke to Stephen, yesterday,

333
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,090
and I know that you called him...

334
00:31:51,063 --> 00:31:53,467
Something educational?

335
00:31:55,167 --> 00:31:56,705
Very.

336
00:31:58,305 --> 00:32:00,964
John is having an affair with Martha.

337
00:32:01,064 --> 00:32:03,677
But... Martha is in love with Alan,

338
00:32:03,777 --> 00:32:08,149
and I think that Alan is probably a
homosexual by the look of his jumper. So...

339
00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:13,216
Well, I'm just trying to work out the
mathematical probability of happiness.

340
00:32:13,721 --> 00:32:15,078
Are you close?

341
00:32:15,178 --> 00:32:19,262
Some integer of zero, but no,
not quite there yet.

342
00:32:22,462 --> 00:32:23,632
Stephen.

343
00:32:24,132 --> 00:32:27,471
You just missed him,
he was here earlier.

344
00:32:29,871 --> 00:32:31,918
Don't do this.

345
00:32:36,411 --> 00:32:37,985
Go.

346
00:32:42,386 --> 00:32:44,221
Croquet.

347
00:32:45,721 --> 00:32:47,998
Play a game with me.

348
00:32:48,924 --> 00:32:50,459
Go.

349
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:58,168
If you don't get up
and play a game with me,

350
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:00,942
I won't come back here again.

351
00:33:04,642 --> 00:33:06,358
Ever.

352
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:21,236
Come on.

353
00:34:50,152 --> 00:34:52,121
Leave me now.

354
00:34:52,221 --> 00:34:55,591
- Are you going to talk about this or not?
- Will you just go?

355
00:34:55,691 --> 00:34:57,595
- Is that what you want?
- Yes, it is what I want.

356
00:34:57,695 --> 00:35:00,732
So, please, if you care about
me at all, then please just go.

357
00:35:00,978 --> 00:35:03,066
- I can't.
- I have two years to live.

358
00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:05,751
- I need to work.
- I love you.

359
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:13,922
That's a false conclusion.

360
00:35:14,022 --> 00:35:15,847
I want us to be together
for as long as we've got,

361
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:20,205
and if that's not very long, well,
then that's just how it is. It'll have to do.

362
00:35:20,305 --> 00:35:24,297
You don't know what's coming.
It'll affect everything.

363
00:35:41,575 --> 00:35:43,791
Your glasses are always dirty.

364
00:36:01,761 --> 00:36:03,198
There.

365
00:36:04,798 --> 00:36:06,038
That's better, isn't it?

366
00:36:07,569 --> 00:36:09,106
Yes.

367
00:36:11,806 --> 00:36:13,667
Yes, it is.

368
00:36:19,948 --> 00:36:23,368
Now the solutions
to the Schrödinger equation

369
00:36:23,468 --> 00:36:28,125
must vanish at the boundary
of the box, and so we have...

370
00:36:29,225 --> 00:36:30,794
Time.

371
00:36:31,894 --> 00:36:34,165
Oh, time, that's your subject?

372
00:36:36,465 --> 00:36:38,801
Any aspect in particular?

373
00:36:38,901 --> 00:36:40,571
Time.

374
00:36:42,272 --> 00:36:44,780
Come in, come in.

375
00:36:54,388 --> 00:37:00,891
I... don't think you realize
what lies ahead, Jane.

376
00:37:01,391 --> 00:37:04,430
His life is going to be very short.

377
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:08,768
So, be careful.

378
00:37:10,468 --> 00:37:13,304
The weight of science is against you,

379
00:37:14,104 --> 00:37:18,778
and this will not be a fight, Jane.

380
00:37:20,578 --> 00:37:24,621
This is going to be a very heavy defeat.

381
00:37:28,387 --> 00:37:30,495
For all of us.

382
00:37:34,862 --> 00:37:37,799
I know what you all think. That...

383
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:43,607
That I don't look like
a terribly strong person.

384
00:37:46,807 --> 00:37:48,891
But I love him,

385
00:37:50,711 --> 00:37:53,483
and he loves me.

386
00:37:56,183 --> 00:37:59,757
We're going to fight
this illness together.

387
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:05,539
All of us.

388
00:39:24,442 --> 00:39:27,054
Two, three...

389
00:39:31,217 --> 00:39:32,944
Good luck.

390
00:39:33,586 --> 00:39:36,209
- Morning, Stephen.
- Morning, Professor.

391
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,467
I know, I know.

392
00:39:47,567 --> 00:39:49,675
- It could be a little bit more elegant.
- Yes, but I...

393
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,050
I understand...

394
00:39:56,076 --> 00:39:58,010
Come in, Stephen.

395
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:08,558
I know it's something we were
all worried about initially,

396
00:40:08,658 --> 00:40:10,192
but I... I knew, Roger...

397
00:40:10,292 --> 00:40:12,028
You had some reservations
about it in the early days.

398
00:40:12,128 --> 00:40:14,496
Yes, but it's not uncommon
in any theory.

399
00:40:14,596 --> 00:40:15,630
Yes.

400
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:18,019
- Absolutely.
- Very well, very well. We'll see.

401
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,670
- Welcome, Stephen.
- Morning.

402
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:24,274
- Would you like to take a seat?
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.

403
00:40:24,374 --> 00:40:25,614
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

404
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:28,946
So, Stephen, in summary,

405
00:40:29,546 --> 00:40:32,449
as we know, chapter one, full of holes,

406
00:40:33,549 --> 00:40:36,800
lacks mathematical support.
Professor Thorne?

407
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,690
Chapter two, not really original.

408
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,692
Uses a lot of Roger's ideas.

409
00:40:41,792 --> 00:40:44,061
Well, at least you run with them.

410
00:40:44,861 --> 00:40:48,331
Chapter three,
too many unanswered questions.

411
00:40:48,431 --> 00:40:49,235
I agree.

412
00:40:49,335 --> 00:40:51,868
And then, of course,
we have chapter four.

413
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:54,939
This black hole
at the beginning of time.

414
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:58,029
- Space-time singularity.
- Indeed.

415
00:40:58,809 --> 00:41:00,416
It's brilliant.

416
00:41:01,027 --> 00:41:04,282
Brilliant, Stephen. Superb.

417
00:41:04,382 --> 00:41:07,251
Therefore, all there is
to say is well done.

418
00:41:07,651 --> 00:41:11,355
Or perhaps I should say,
to be more precise, well done, Doctor.

419
00:41:11,455 --> 00:41:12,813
Bravo, Stephen.

420
00:41:12,913 --> 00:41:15,525
An extraordinary theory.

421
00:41:17,564 --> 00:41:19,401
Thank you.

422
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,858
- So, what next?
- Prove it.

423
00:41:25,637 --> 00:41:29,075
To prove with a single equation

424
00:41:29,175 --> 00:41:31,939
that time has a beginning.

425
00:41:35,114 --> 00:41:37,552
Wouldn't that be nice, Professor?

426
00:41:39,352 --> 00:41:44,827
The one simple, elegant equation

427
00:41:46,927 --> 00:41:49,397
to explain everything.

428
00:41:49,747 --> 00:41:51,433
Yes, it would.

429
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:54,370
It would indeed.

430
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,788
Thank you.

431
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:17,993
To the esteemed and formidable

432
00:42:18,193 --> 00:42:20,202
- Doctor...
- Who?

433
00:42:22,431 --> 00:42:25,003
Doctor Stephen Hawking.

434
00:42:25,103 --> 00:42:27,205
Doctor Stephen Hawking.

435
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:30,836
Thank you.

436
00:42:31,608 --> 00:42:33,610
It is astonishing he's the first
person to receive his doctorate

437
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:35,665
bearing in mind how little
work he's been doing.

438
00:42:37,136 --> 00:42:39,250
Work was the worst
four-letter word for Stephen.

439
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:44,622
At Oxford especially, he averaged an hour.
An hour a day, he averaged.

440
00:42:44,722 --> 00:42:46,791
And now, here he is, the esteemed man.

441
00:42:46,891 --> 00:42:49,927
- Astonishing levels of sloth.
- I've got... on the theme of sloth, Brian,

442
00:42:50,027 --> 00:42:52,529
how many of your lectures have
I covered in the last six months?

443
00:42:52,629 --> 00:42:55,599
When you've been doing research
trips up to the Lake District.

444
00:42:55,699 --> 00:42:57,335
- Absolutely, completely...
- So have I!

445
00:42:57,435 --> 00:42:58,637
- How many?
- Four.

446
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:29,367
- Everything all right?
- All good. I'm fine.

447
00:43:45,985 --> 00:43:47,889
- What can you do?
- Would you like kartoffel?

448
00:43:47,989 --> 00:43:49,475
Oh, please.

449
00:43:55,264 --> 00:43:58,198
- Business or pleasure?
- For pleasure.

450
00:44:20,188 --> 00:44:21,691
Hey, Robbie.

451
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:27,891
It's okay, Robbie.

452
00:46:16,678 --> 00:46:18,398
This

453
00:46:19,582 --> 00:46:21,106
is

454
00:46:22,063 --> 00:46:24,222
temporary.

455
00:46:26,456 --> 00:46:28,330
Of course.

456
00:46:34,798 --> 00:46:37,858
Well, it's convenient for breakfast.

457
00:46:50,448 --> 00:46:52,218
Thank you.

458
00:46:55,419 --> 00:46:57,625
Sorry, did you say something?

459
00:47:00,625 --> 00:47:02,698
I said...

460
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,871
Yes?

461
00:47:10,034 --> 00:47:11,967
...thank you.

462
00:47:41,969 --> 00:47:44,337
There we go, Lucy.

463
00:47:52,413 --> 00:47:54,182
There we go.

464
00:47:56,552 --> 00:47:58,353
There we go.

465
00:47:59,053 --> 00:48:01,090
Have you got her?

466
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:03,893
She looks like you.

467
00:48:08,596 --> 00:48:10,267
Oh, no.

468
00:48:11,567 --> 00:48:13,803
Oh, wait. Go, Jane.

469
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:17,196
I'll be one second.

470
00:48:18,074 --> 00:48:20,885
Luce! Lucy.

471
00:48:33,223 --> 00:48:35,086
Jane?

472
00:49:03,688 --> 00:49:07,026
Oh, Stephen. Oh. Hello.

473
00:49:09,862 --> 00:49:11,949
I've got an idea.

474
00:49:15,034 --> 00:49:18,695
Jane... Jane, I've had an idea.

475
00:49:29,983 --> 00:49:31,553
- Hello.
- Hello, Dennis.

476
00:49:31,653 --> 00:49:33,520
- Hello, Dennis.
- How are you?

477
00:49:35,289 --> 00:49:39,863
- Okay. Good luck.
- He'll be fine. He'll be fine.

478
00:49:41,663 --> 00:49:43,930
- Oops. Sorry.
- No problem.

479
00:49:52,173 --> 00:49:55,608
Allowing us to predict

480
00:49:56,212 --> 00:50:02,584
that some particles can,
in fact, escape a black hole.

481
00:50:02,885 --> 00:50:08,826
So, black holes are not,
in fact, black at all,

482
00:50:09,526 --> 00:50:14,832
but glow with heat radiation.

483
00:50:16,432 --> 00:50:19,602
The steady emission of heat energy

484
00:50:20,303 --> 00:50:24,742
causes the black holes to lose mass

485
00:50:25,842 --> 00:50:33,150
and eventually they disappear
in a spectacular explosion.

486
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:36,087
It's very, very simple,
in the way that a body loses heat.

487
00:50:36,187 --> 00:50:38,822
- Second law of thermodynamics.
- Right, it's thermodynamics.

488
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:44,195
If we can imagine that a black hole
is, indeed, losing particles

489
00:50:44,295 --> 00:50:47,599
and over time, will diminish in size,
it will evaporate, it will...

490
00:50:47,699 --> 00:50:49,735
Disappear.

491
00:50:51,635 --> 00:50:52,557
So...

492
00:50:57,075 --> 00:50:58,644
First

493
00:50:58,944 --> 00:51:04,651
a star vanishes into a black hole.

494
00:51:05,451 --> 00:51:07,605
And then

495
00:51:07,787 --> 00:51:10,925
the black hole itself

496
00:51:12,225 --> 00:51:13,893
vanishes.

497
00:51:13,993 --> 00:51:15,161
Gone, nothing.

498
00:51:15,261 --> 00:51:19,241
- From nothing to nothing!
- You owe me another beer.

499
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:24,072
I have just shown you that our friend has
proven that time, indeed, has a beginning.

500
00:51:24,472 --> 00:51:27,228
Not only that,
how the universe was born, and...

501
00:51:27,328 --> 00:51:29,611
- How it will end.
- Bang!

502
00:51:31,511 --> 00:51:33,062
Crunch!

503
00:51:34,515 --> 00:51:37,619
It's, beautiful, it's racy, it's...

504
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:39,499
Complete nonsense!

505
00:51:40,387 --> 00:51:42,059
It's preposterous!

506
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:47,130
Was it something I said, Professor?

507
00:51:49,761 --> 00:51:51,455
Excuse me.

508
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:57,172
My name...
My name is Professor Khalatnikov

509
00:51:57,272 --> 00:52:00,709
from the Soviet Academy of Science.
As you know,

510
00:52:00,809 --> 00:52:04,215
my field is evolution
of the hot universe,

511
00:52:04,315 --> 00:52:08,117
the properties of the microwave
background radiation

512
00:52:08,217 --> 00:52:10,553
and the theory of black holes.

513
00:52:11,303 --> 00:52:13,456
To be honest,

514
00:52:13,656 --> 00:52:16,026
I came here today

515
00:52:16,126 --> 00:52:20,061
expecting to hear a lot of nonsense.

516
00:52:20,732 --> 00:52:23,100
I go home disappointed.

517
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,636
The little one here

518
00:52:26,636 --> 00:52:27,837
has done it!

519
00:52:29,139 --> 00:52:31,357
He has done it!

520
00:52:38,883 --> 00:52:41,520
It is a pleasure to meet you, Professor.

521
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:44,587
Entirely my pleasure. My pleasure.

522
00:52:46,058 --> 00:52:48,680
- Thank you.
- Well done, Stephen.

523
00:52:49,327 --> 00:52:52,631
Well, that went pretty well,
all things considered.

524
00:52:52,731 --> 00:52:54,877
I was worried for a while.

525
00:52:58,171 --> 00:53:01,674
- Hawking radiation!
- The little one has done it!

526
00:53:01,774 --> 00:53:03,476
The little one has done it!

527
00:53:04,677 --> 00:53:07,300
- Hey, come on, genius!
- Oh, very funny!

528
00:53:10,851 --> 00:53:14,021
You've had enough of that, old man.
Come on, codger.

529
00:53:14,521 --> 00:53:18,025
One, two, three!

530
00:53:19,426 --> 00:53:22,331
My God! How does Jane manage?

531
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:27,268
Stephen,

532
00:53:27,369 --> 00:53:30,472
your motor-mouth disease,
does it affect...

533
00:53:31,272 --> 00:53:32,794
What?

534
00:53:33,208 --> 00:53:34,881
Everything?

535
00:53:35,943 --> 00:53:39,815
What? No. Different system.

536
00:53:40,115 --> 00:53:43,174
- Automatic.
- Are you serious?

537
00:53:43,919 --> 00:53:46,355
Well, that's pretty wonderful, isn't it?

538
00:53:46,455 --> 00:53:49,044
Well, it certainly
explains a lot about men.

539
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:52,171
Hurry up!

540
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,451
Come on!

541
00:54:03,172 --> 00:54:05,001
Please.

542
00:54:27,798 --> 00:54:29,533
What is it?

543
00:54:29,633 --> 00:54:31,537
It's a surprise.

544
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:34,135
Right.

545
00:54:35,073 --> 00:54:36,506
Keep them closed.

546
00:54:37,609 --> 00:54:39,477
Ta-da!

547
00:54:39,877 --> 00:54:41,249
Look, Daddy, look!

548
00:54:41,349 --> 00:54:46,428
That is an electric wheelchair.
If you don't like it, we can take it back.

549
00:55:10,044 --> 00:55:13,213
I don't understand. You've spent years

550
00:55:13,413 --> 00:55:17,624
assuming black holes exist
and you believe Cygnus X-1

551
00:55:17,724 --> 00:55:21,990
could well turn out to be the first
black hole that we can actually observe.

552
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:24,458
And yet, you've bet Kip Thorne
it's not a black hole.

553
00:55:24,558 --> 00:55:26,660
- Yes.
- What did you bet him?

554
00:55:26,761 --> 00:55:31,599
A one-year subscription to a magazine.

555
00:55:31,899 --> 00:55:34,602
- Which magazine? <i>Nature?</i>
- No.

556
00:55:35,102 --> 00:55:36,571
<i>Penthouse.</i>

557
00:55:36,871 --> 00:55:39,407
<i>- Penthouse?</i>
- Yes.

558
00:55:39,507 --> 00:55:41,551
Gonna get you!

559
00:55:44,881 --> 00:55:47,617
Daddy, look out! Let's get Mummy!

560
00:55:47,717 --> 00:55:49,719
Come on...

561
00:55:50,119 --> 00:55:52,009
Gonna get you.

562
00:55:52,522 --> 00:55:55,356
Mummy, Mummy! Come and look!

563
00:55:58,794 --> 00:56:01,197
We're gonna get you.

564
00:56:01,397 --> 00:56:02,601
Come on.

565
00:56:07,838 --> 00:56:09,166
Holiday!

566
00:56:09,266 --> 00:56:10,466
Holiday!

567
00:56:10,566 --> 00:56:11,996
- Holiday!
- Holiday!

568
00:56:12,096 --> 00:56:14,275
Holiday! Holiday...

569
00:56:22,786 --> 00:56:24,363
- Hello!
- Hello!

570
00:56:24,463 --> 00:56:25,630
- Hello.
- There you are.

571
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:28,225
- Hello, Pa!
- Isn't it marvelous?

572
00:56:28,525 --> 00:56:31,296
- What about these steps, Frank?
- Steps are nothing, Jane.

573
00:56:31,396 --> 00:56:34,396
- Stephen! Here we are!
- Hello!

574
00:56:34,496 --> 00:56:38,838
Yes, here we go. Once we're up at the top,
it's very snug. Hello, Stephen.

575
00:56:38,938 --> 00:56:41,074
- Hello.
- There we go.

576
00:56:41,474 --> 00:56:43,542
- Turn you around, Stephen.
- Want me to pull?

577
00:56:43,642 --> 00:56:48,101
No, no, I'll be fine. You get the luggage.
Here we go. Off we go. Let's go.

578
00:56:51,516 --> 00:56:54,488
There we are, you see? Quite easy.

579
00:56:55,088 --> 00:56:57,091
Up one, there we go.

580
00:56:57,390 --> 00:56:59,291
Shimmering?

581
00:57:00,185 --> 00:57:04,698
- The... Oh, rain coming down, shivering cold?
- Cold?

582
00:57:04,798 --> 00:57:08,435
No. The... falling.

583
00:57:08,535 --> 00:57:10,007
Falling...

584
00:57:12,707 --> 00:57:16,185
- Very cold.
- What is it? I... I'm...

585
00:57:16,285 --> 00:57:18,478
having a jolly...

586
00:57:18,578 --> 00:57:20,547
Okay, take Lucy. One minute.

587
00:57:21,749 --> 00:57:22,884
What is it?

588
00:57:28,723 --> 00:57:30,402
Is it out?

589
00:57:31,627 --> 00:57:34,136
- Some... some water?
- No, don't worry.

590
00:57:35,196 --> 00:57:38,432
Okay, that's it. There we go.

591
00:57:38,967 --> 00:57:43,372
It's okay. It's okay.
He needs to see a specialist.

592
00:57:43,472 --> 00:57:45,507
Keeps happening over and over again.

593
00:57:45,607 --> 00:57:48,717
- Ridiculous.
- No doctors.

594
00:57:49,044 --> 00:57:51,940
No doctors.

595
00:57:52,549 --> 00:57:55,005
All right, no doctors.

596
00:57:59,355 --> 00:58:00,970
A little water.

597
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:40,688
Stephen.

598
00:58:43,803 --> 00:58:45,451
I need help.

599
00:58:47,807 --> 00:58:51,611
If only for Robert.
He's missing out on his childhood.

600
00:58:52,713 --> 00:58:55,817
I keep looking for a way
to make this work, but...

601
00:58:56,583 --> 00:58:58,585
I can't find it on my own.

602
00:58:58,685 --> 00:59:03,389
Everything is fine.
We're just a normal family.

603
00:59:03,489 --> 00:59:06,196
We're not a normal family.

604
00:59:10,097 --> 00:59:12,336
We're not a normal family!

605
00:59:15,336 --> 00:59:16,775
Robert.

606
00:59:17,571 --> 00:59:21,452
Your mother is very angry with me.

607
00:59:28,916 --> 00:59:30,554
Thanks.

608
00:59:40,628 --> 00:59:42,169
Jane.

609
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:49,730
Jane, stop.

610
00:59:57,079 --> 00:59:58,621
Sit.

611
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:13,947
Now,

612
01:00:15,966 --> 01:00:18,419
I'd like to make a suggestion.

613
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:25,263
Might sound a bit unusual,
but I have seen it work wonders.

614
01:00:25,677 --> 01:00:27,346
I think

615
01:00:27,446 --> 01:00:31,169
that you should consider joining
the church choir.

616
01:00:36,923 --> 01:00:38,591
Mum,

617
01:00:38,691 --> 01:00:43,265
I think that's possibly the most English
thing anyone has ever said.

618
01:00:45,065 --> 01:00:46,860
Maybe so.

619
01:00:48,835 --> 01:00:52,139
- I used to love singing.
- You're very good at it.

620
01:00:52,239 --> 01:00:54,140
I don't know about that.

621
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,991
Just go.

622
01:00:58,378 --> 01:01:00,213
It's one hour a week.

623
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:47,834
Really lovely, everyone.
Okay. See you next week.

624
01:01:51,534 --> 01:01:53,268
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

625
01:01:54,938 --> 01:01:56,356
Good-bye.

626
01:01:59,277 --> 01:02:00,711
- Hello.
- Hello.

627
01:02:00,811 --> 01:02:02,846
Have you come to sing?

628
01:02:04,616 --> 01:02:06,726
I just came to...

629
01:02:09,053 --> 01:02:12,222
- Soprano?
- Mezzo.

630
01:02:12,322 --> 01:02:15,527
Lovely, just what we need.
Where have you been hiding?

631
01:02:15,827 --> 01:02:17,362
Good question.

632
01:02:17,462 --> 01:02:22,540
Well, you're here now, and...
just in time, as they say.

633
01:02:27,573 --> 01:02:29,810
Oh, you know, I have to
come back anyway, so...

634
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:30,989
- Good.
- You have everything?

635
01:02:31,089 --> 01:02:34,013
- Yes, thank you. Yes.
- Thank you for coming.

636
01:02:34,113 --> 01:02:37,177
You will be a valuable asset.

637
01:02:37,277 --> 01:02:38,564
Thank you.

638
01:02:42,054 --> 01:02:44,023
Well, I should be going.

639
01:02:44,123 --> 01:02:46,693
And if your son wants
those piano lessons, just...

640
01:02:46,793 --> 01:02:49,563
- Yes, yes, absolutely. I...
- Call me.

641
01:02:49,663 --> 01:02:50,897
- I will do.
- Great.

642
01:02:50,997 --> 01:02:53,734
My husband adores music, too.

643
01:02:53,834 --> 01:02:57,405
Oh, well, I could... Does he play?

644
01:02:58,506 --> 01:03:00,850
I could teach him, as well.

645
01:03:01,374 --> 01:03:03,439
That's a long story.

646
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:05,947
- But...
- Okay.

647
01:03:06,047 --> 01:03:08,449
- Well, thank you, Jonathan.
- My pleasure, Jane. See you again.

648
01:03:08,549 --> 01:03:10,260
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

649
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:36,588
Third finger. No, that...
That one, there.

650
01:03:37,179 --> 01:03:41,780
Try lifting your wrists a little bit.
Keep your elbows back. Okay, try again.

651
01:03:43,386 --> 01:03:44,797
No.

652
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:56,740
- Yeah.
- Good.

653
01:04:03,141 --> 01:04:04,643
More wine?

654
01:04:05,943 --> 01:04:07,327
Why not? Thank you.

655
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:10,405
- Stephen?
- No.

656
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,323
Stephen, Jane was telling me
that you have a beautiful, theorem.

657
01:04:36,009 --> 01:04:40,749
That proves that the universe,
had a beginning. Is that it?

658
01:04:43,249 --> 01:04:47,588
That was my PhD thesis.

659
01:04:49,088 --> 01:04:53,761
My new project disproves it.

660
01:04:54,161 --> 01:04:56,664
- Disproves it?
- Yes.

661
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:01,868
So then you no longer believe
in the creation?

662
01:05:02,068 --> 01:05:08,377
What one believes
is irrelevant in physics.

663
01:05:08,677 --> 01:05:10,311
"Irrelevant in physics."

664
01:05:13,047 --> 01:05:14,147
I see.

665
01:05:14,817 --> 01:05:16,484
Stephen's done a U-turn.

666
01:05:16,584 --> 01:05:20,855
The big new idea is that the universe
has no boundaries at all.

667
01:05:20,955 --> 01:05:22,890
No boundaries, no beginning.

668
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:25,195
And no God.

669
01:05:26,095 --> 01:05:29,366
Oh, I see. I... I thought that...

670
01:05:29,466 --> 01:05:33,611
you'd proved the universe had a beginning
and thus a need for a creator.

671
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:36,306
My mistake.

672
01:05:36,406 --> 01:05:39,750
No, mine.

673
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:46,785
Stephen is looking for a single theory
that explains all the forces in the universe.

674
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:49,552
Therefore, God must die.

675
01:05:49,652 --> 01:05:52,523
Oh, why must God die? I don't see.

676
01:05:53,083 --> 01:05:56,067
The two great pillars of physics

677
01:05:56,167 --> 01:05:58,630
are quantum theory,

678
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:03,035
the laws that govern the very
small particles, electrons and so on,

679
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:05,904
and general relativity.

680
01:06:06,371 --> 01:06:07,639
Yes, Einstein.

681
01:06:07,739 --> 01:06:10,909
Einstein's theory, the laws that govern
the very large planets and such.

682
01:06:11,009 --> 01:06:14,379
But quantum and relativity...

683
01:06:14,479 --> 01:06:16,515
Don't tell me. They're different?

684
01:06:16,715 --> 01:06:20,053
They don't remotely
play by the same rules.

685
01:06:20,253 --> 01:06:23,956
If the world were all potatoes,
then, easy.

686
01:06:24,056 --> 01:06:28,994
You could trace a precise beginning
as Stephen once did.

687
01:06:29,094 --> 01:06:31,231
A moment of creation.

688
01:06:31,931 --> 01:06:35,069
Hallelujah. God lives.

689
01:06:35,169 --> 01:06:38,571
If you incorporate peas into the menu,
well, then it all goes a little...

690
01:06:38,671 --> 01:06:40,207
Tits up.

691
01:06:40,907 --> 01:06:42,975
Yes. Haywire.

692
01:06:43,075 --> 01:06:45,779
- It just all becomes a godless mess.
- Oh, dear.

693
01:06:45,879 --> 01:06:48,348
Einstein hated peas.

694
01:06:48,748 --> 01:06:53,622
Quantum theory. He said,
"God doesn't play dice with the universe."

695
01:06:53,922 --> 01:06:57,658
Seems he not only plays dice,

696
01:06:58,258 --> 01:07:03,198
but he throws them
where we can't find them.

697
01:07:03,298 --> 01:07:06,410
God is back on
the endangered species list.

698
01:07:07,201 --> 01:07:09,572
Well, I expect he'll cope.

699
01:07:09,672 --> 01:07:13,875
And physics is back in business.

700
01:07:13,975 --> 01:07:15,307
Yes.

701
01:07:16,744 --> 01:07:19,324
Physics is back in business.

702
01:07:30,225 --> 01:07:32,930
I was... married, actually.

703
01:07:35,274 --> 01:07:37,268
But, sadly, she passed.

704
01:07:38,868 --> 01:07:41,041
Almost a year ago now.

705
01:07:43,239 --> 01:07:45,411
It was... leukemia.

706
01:07:47,711 --> 01:07:51,548
She fought it and I nursed her. But...

707
01:07:51,648 --> 01:07:53,517
in the end...

708
01:07:58,756 --> 01:08:01,026
I do get quite lonely.

709
01:08:01,326 --> 01:08:04,162
The... tyranny of the empty room

710
01:08:05,162 --> 01:08:06,924
and all that.

711
01:08:07,933 --> 01:08:11,503
But music is my salvation.
Teaching and playing.

712
01:08:11,603 --> 01:08:16,175
Not really as a career, but I'm not
very ambitious. Though that's not...

713
01:08:22,481 --> 01:08:25,388
Is that a sin? I don't know.

714
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:29,893
Wrong man to ask.

715
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:36,864
Thank you so much for having me.

716
01:08:36,964 --> 01:08:40,200
- Thank you for coming.
- It was really, really wonderful.

717
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:44,472
If there's anything I can do
to be of service, to you,

718
01:08:44,572 --> 01:08:48,777
to the family, I mean,
I would consider it a privilege.

719
01:08:48,977 --> 01:08:52,780
I have no children or commitments, so...

720
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:55,630
I only mean that if I could be of help,

721
01:08:55,730 --> 01:08:59,020
I believe I might find
a purpose that would...

722
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:02,358
help alleviate my own, situation.

723
01:09:04,458 --> 01:09:06,028
Good night.

724
01:09:06,128 --> 01:09:07,499
Night.

725
01:09:43,301 --> 01:09:46,126
I understand

726
01:09:48,072 --> 01:09:51,034
if you need help.

727
01:09:53,778 --> 01:09:56,625
If someone is

728
01:09:56,725 --> 01:09:59,850
prepared to offer it,

729
01:10:03,221 --> 01:10:06,262
I won't object.

730
01:10:48,669 --> 01:10:51,872
- Chilly?
- Yeah, it's very bracing.

731
01:11:23,874 --> 01:11:25,441
Come on. Ready?

732
01:11:25,541 --> 01:11:27,245
- Yeah.
- All right.

733
01:11:29,545 --> 01:11:32,122
17, 18...

734
01:11:39,923 --> 01:11:42,601
There we go. Right.
I'm going to put the kettle on.

735
01:12:31,079 --> 01:12:33,893
<i>Calls you one and calls you all</i>

736
01:12:33,993 --> 01:12:37,406
<i>To gain his everlasting hall</i>

737
01:12:37,506 --> 01:12:40,794
<i>Christ was born to save</i>

738
01:12:40,894 --> 01:12:44,258
<i>Christ was born to save</i>

739
01:12:44,358 --> 01:12:46,847
Great, lovely, okay. We can go.

740
01:12:47,663 --> 01:12:49,364
Just gone 7:45.

741
01:12:50,764 --> 01:12:53,574
- Could you all leave your copies?
- Good-bye.

742
01:12:59,874 --> 01:13:01,258
There's something I need to tell you.

743
01:13:02,443 --> 01:13:03,902
What?

744
01:13:04,447 --> 01:13:06,215
I'm pregnant.

745
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:11,496
Gosh, I, assumed that you and Stephen...

746
01:13:13,221 --> 01:13:15,992
Well, that's really wonderful.

747
01:13:16,292 --> 01:13:19,495
- It is.
- Yes, wonderful.

748
01:13:19,995 --> 01:13:22,268
Congratulations, Jane.

749
01:13:22,465 --> 01:13:24,183
Thank you.

750
01:13:39,372 --> 01:13:42,754
Everyone say, "Cheese." Ready?
On the count of three. One, two, three.

751
01:13:42,854 --> 01:13:44,657
Cheese!

752
01:13:45,957 --> 01:13:47,491
Cheese.

753
01:13:51,728 --> 01:13:55,703
Is that your brother? On his bike?

754
01:13:57,403 --> 01:13:59,871
- Mummy!
- Just coming.

755
01:13:59,971 --> 01:14:02,714
Oh, come on, sweetie. Come on...

756
01:14:09,514 --> 01:14:11,350
Now, you know

757
01:14:11,450 --> 01:14:15,358
I've always been supportive of
your choice not to have home help,

758
01:14:15,458 --> 01:14:18,417
but we need to find
a permanent solution.

759
01:14:18,517 --> 01:14:21,872
This... this...
situation cannot continue.

760
01:14:21,972 --> 01:14:27,367
You need to have a proper
live-in nurse immediately.

761
01:14:27,467 --> 01:14:29,202
We have help.

762
01:14:29,903 --> 01:14:33,474
Look, you know what I'm talking about.

763
01:14:33,574 --> 01:14:36,945
We can't afford a live-in nurse.

764
01:14:37,045 --> 01:14:41,048
Stephen, you need to find a way
for your family's sake.

765
01:14:41,148 --> 01:14:42,884
You're world-famous.

766
01:14:42,984 --> 01:14:47,656
For black holes, not for rock concerts.

767
01:14:47,756 --> 01:14:50,191
Stephen, this isn't funny.

768
01:14:50,491 --> 01:14:52,577
I believe it's urgent.

769
01:15:13,883 --> 01:15:15,952
We do have a right to know.

770
01:15:16,052 --> 01:15:18,691
We have a right to know, Jane.

771
01:15:21,392 --> 01:15:23,428
Know what?

772
01:15:24,128 --> 01:15:29,434
Whose child Timothy is.
Stephen's or Jonathan's.

773
01:15:31,534 --> 01:15:33,773
That's what you think of me.

774
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:38,910
There's no way that Timothy could have
any other father than Stephen.

775
01:15:39,010 --> 01:15:40,748
None.

776
01:15:51,222 --> 01:15:55,459
- Jonathan. Please don't go.
- I have to go. Come on. Everyone is talking.

777
01:15:55,762 --> 01:15:56,971
So, what does it matter?

778
01:15:57,071 --> 01:15:59,332
It's difficult for me
because I'm just trying to help.

779
01:15:59,432 --> 01:16:01,368
I know you're trying to help,
and your help is valued.

780
01:16:01,468 --> 01:16:04,603
The best thing for me right now is...
I think maybe if...

781
01:16:04,703 --> 01:16:08,274
- I just step back for now.
- Please, Jonathan. We need you.

782
01:16:08,374 --> 01:16:11,849
The children need you, and I need you,
and Stephen needs you. Jonathan.

783
01:16:11,949 --> 01:16:15,282
There's other things as well. Jane, I...

784
01:16:17,484 --> 01:16:19,318
I have feelings for you.

785
01:16:23,590 --> 01:16:26,498
And I have feelings for you, too.

786
01:16:31,399 --> 01:16:33,182
Thank you, Jane.

787
01:17:21,685 --> 01:17:26,823
I've been invited to the Bordeaux Opera.

788
01:17:26,923 --> 01:17:28,779
Invited where?

789
01:17:29,059 --> 01:17:30,981
Bordeaux.

790
01:17:32,263 --> 01:17:33,998
To Bordeaux?

791
01:17:34,998 --> 01:17:36,834
Wagner.

792
01:17:36,934 --> 01:17:39,504
The students can take me.

793
01:17:40,004 --> 01:17:42,773
I know you hate flying.

794
01:17:44,208 --> 01:17:46,377
I do hate to fly.

795
01:17:46,477 --> 01:17:49,046
Bring the car.

796
01:17:49,146 --> 01:17:52,985
Meet me in Bordeaux.

797
01:17:54,385 --> 01:17:58,059
Take the children camping.

798
01:18:00,359 --> 01:18:03,435
It'll be too difficult
to manage, Stephen.

799
01:18:09,235 --> 01:18:13,110
Bring Jonathan.

800
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:20,450
I doubt he would be willing.

801
01:18:37,531 --> 01:18:39,250
Hello, Stephen.

802
01:18:55,251 --> 01:18:57,085
Is this okay?

803
01:18:57,185 --> 01:18:58,988
Well...

804
01:18:59,488 --> 01:19:01,533
I won't tell if you won't.

805
01:19:12,504 --> 01:19:14,079
Just...

806
01:19:14,903 --> 01:19:17,177
bearing in mind you have to drive.

807
01:19:32,723 --> 01:19:35,841
Jane needs help.

808
01:19:49,542 --> 01:19:52,348
Sarah, you won't forget a vitamin
B injection as soon as you land.

809
01:19:52,448 --> 01:19:54,399
- No. Of course.
- And you'll call me when you get to the hotel?

810
01:19:54,499 --> 01:19:55,426
- I will.
- Yes? Promise?

811
01:19:55,526 --> 01:19:57,440
- Yes.
- Good.

812
01:19:57,883 --> 01:19:59,434
Stephen.

813
01:20:01,788 --> 01:20:03,921
Mum will take the baby.

814
01:20:04,390 --> 01:20:07,894
- She'll be here any minute.
- See you in Bordeaux.

815
01:20:08,394 --> 01:20:09,874
And be good.

816
01:20:33,988 --> 01:20:37,009
- Are they asleep?
- Yeah.

817
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:55,263
- Okay. It's okay. I'm all right.
- Where are the children?

818
01:21:08,392 --> 01:21:10,560
I think we've done rather well.

819
01:21:11,128 --> 01:21:14,307
Right. Children? Get your sleeping bags.

820
01:21:16,367 --> 01:21:17,976
Thank you.

821
01:21:30,281 --> 01:21:32,214
Thank you. Thanks.

822
01:22:37,819 --> 01:22:39,595
Jonathan?

823
01:23:14,058 --> 01:23:15,194
Oh, God!

824
01:23:17,494 --> 01:23:19,362
Excuse me, sorry.

825
01:23:52,463 --> 01:23:54,166
Jonathan?

826
01:23:54,266 --> 01:23:56,002
Jonathan.

827
01:23:56,102 --> 01:23:59,472
Stephen's been taken ill.
He's in hospital and...

828
01:23:59,572 --> 01:24:02,473
- he... he's in a coma.
- Stephen's been taken ill?

829
01:24:56,899 --> 01:24:58,887
What are you talking about?

830
01:25:02,273 --> 01:25:03,975
This way would be a painless end.

831
01:25:04,075 --> 01:25:07,078
If we try to bring him round
from the anesthetic,

832
01:25:07,178 --> 01:25:09,267
it's not sure
he will survive resuscitation.

833
01:25:11,048 --> 01:25:13,460
You have to bring him round
from the anesthetic.

834
01:25:14,851 --> 01:25:17,422
Are you sure it's what you want?

835
01:25:18,423 --> 01:25:23,194
The only way of weaning him off the
ventilator will be to give him a tracheotomy.

836
01:25:23,794 --> 01:25:27,799
A hole in the neck,
bypassing the throat.

837
01:25:29,099 --> 01:25:31,240
He will never speak again.

838
01:25:35,641 --> 01:25:37,596
There's no question.

839
01:25:38,877 --> 01:25:43,783
Stephen must live.
I will see he gets everything he needs.

840
01:25:43,883 --> 01:25:46,898
I will have him transferred
back to Cambridge.

841
01:25:49,621 --> 01:25:51,644
He may not survive the journey.

842
01:25:52,592 --> 01:25:54,417
Yes, he will.

843
01:26:02,302 --> 01:26:03,605
I know.

844
01:26:05,805 --> 01:26:07,241
I'll...

845
01:26:08,108 --> 01:26:09,690
step back.

846
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:17,919
Did you get everything in the car?
His chair and his equipment and everything?

847
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:40,828
Good-bye.

848
01:28:15,710 --> 01:28:17,631
Stephen?

849
01:28:36,332 --> 01:28:39,073
This is a spelling board.

850
01:28:40,904 --> 01:28:45,003
Firstly, you tell me what letter
you want by blinking

851
01:28:45,103 --> 01:28:48,932
when I say the color of the group
that contains the letter.

852
01:28:50,948 --> 01:28:54,852
Once I know the group, you can choose
the character inside that group

853
01:28:54,952 --> 01:28:58,890
by blinking again when I say the color
of each letter within that group.

854
01:29:01,692 --> 01:29:03,375
Apparently.

855
01:29:04,365 --> 01:29:06,226
Let's just try.

856
01:29:10,468 --> 01:29:12,256
Green.

857
01:29:15,105 --> 01:29:16,643
Blue.

858
01:29:18,610 --> 01:29:20,148
Pink.

859
01:29:22,948 --> 01:29:24,485
Black.

860
01:29:26,151 --> 01:29:27,556
Red.

861
01:29:30,990 --> 01:29:34,669
Blink to choose the color of the group
of the letter you want, Stephen.

862
01:29:46,038 --> 01:29:47,807
Green.

863
01:29:50,110 --> 01:29:51,698
Blue.

864
01:29:55,449 --> 01:29:56,967
Pink.

865
01:30:02,656 --> 01:30:04,384
Black.

866
01:30:08,964 --> 01:30:10,680
Red.

867
01:30:40,797 --> 01:30:42,633
Hello, Elaine.

868
01:30:42,733 --> 01:30:44,902
- Shall I take your coat?
- Okay.

869
01:30:45,002 --> 01:30:46,605
Thank you, Jane.

870
01:30:53,276 --> 01:30:55,525
- Just wait here.
- Great.

871
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:03,860
She's here.

872
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:06,778
She comes highly recommended.

873
01:31:08,994 --> 01:31:11,439
Promise not to eat her alive.

874
01:31:13,298 --> 01:31:14,799
Okay?

875
01:31:26,312 --> 01:31:28,039
Here we are.

876
01:31:29,849 --> 01:31:32,151
Elaine, Stephen.

877
01:31:33,352 --> 01:31:37,022
- Stephen, Elaine.
- Lovely to meet you, Professor.

878
01:31:38,424 --> 01:31:40,827
Now, you should have
everything you need.

879
01:31:40,927 --> 01:31:44,063
But if there's anything else,
I'll be just next door.

880
01:31:44,163 --> 01:31:45,598
Great.

881
01:31:45,698 --> 01:31:49,335
I think we'll get straight to work.
Thank you, Jane.

882
01:31:49,435 --> 01:31:52,648
- Oh, if you could close the doors.
- Of course.

883
01:31:58,513 --> 01:32:00,768
We'll get started, then.

884
01:32:02,417 --> 01:32:03,905
Okay.

885
01:32:12,528 --> 01:32:14,049
Red.

886
01:32:16,631 --> 01:32:18,047
Yellow.

887
01:32:18,599 --> 01:32:20,004
T.

888
01:32:23,104 --> 01:32:24,733
Green.

889
01:32:25,407 --> 01:32:28,377
Black. E.

890
01:32:29,012 --> 01:32:32,248
Green, green. A.

891
01:32:32,348 --> 01:32:34,036
Tea.

892
01:32:34,617 --> 01:32:36,155
You want a cup of tea.

893
01:32:39,455 --> 01:32:40,639
Okay.

894
01:32:44,594 --> 01:32:46,233
Any preference?

895
01:32:49,333 --> 01:32:52,338
You've memorized the board,
I know you have.

896
01:32:54,138 --> 01:32:56,204
I haven't got all day.

897
01:32:58,341 --> 01:33:00,978
Green, green.

898
01:33:01,078 --> 01:33:02,864
Green, yellow.

899
01:33:02,964 --> 01:33:05,384
Yellow. B.

900
01:33:06,284 --> 01:33:09,021
Green, blue, pink, black, red.

901
01:33:09,421 --> 01:33:10,777
Red.

902
01:33:10,877 --> 01:33:13,324
Green, yellow, blue, blue.

903
01:33:13,424 --> 01:33:16,270
U. So, B, U.

904
01:33:17,397 --> 01:33:19,167
Builder's tea, right?

905
01:33:27,706 --> 01:33:29,709
So, how did you get on?

906
01:33:29,809 --> 01:33:33,947
You know... I think he's the
most brilliant man I've ever met.

907
01:33:34,047 --> 01:33:36,616
- You're very lucky.
- Thank you.

908
01:33:36,716 --> 01:33:40,485
- You must worship the ground beneath...
- His wheels?

909
01:33:41,276 --> 01:33:44,390
And he's the perfect patient.
He's so funny!

910
01:33:44,490 --> 01:33:48,697
- When you read about him...
- Let's see how you get on, shall we, Elaine?

911
01:33:49,998 --> 01:33:51,967
That's tightened up.

912
01:33:52,867 --> 01:33:55,669
As you can see, it's height-adjustable

913
01:33:55,769 --> 01:33:59,039
and we can change the angle
to whatever Steve wants it at.

914
01:33:59,139 --> 01:34:01,342
- You know, it's cutting-edge.
- So, how does it work?

915
01:34:01,442 --> 01:34:04,979
It uses a very simple interface
that scans through the alphabet,

916
01:34:05,079 --> 01:34:08,497
selects each letter one at a time.
I mean, using this technique,

917
01:34:08,597 --> 01:34:12,387
the Professor can expect to write
about four words per minute.

918
01:34:12,487 --> 01:34:14,456
Good. Better than one a minute.

919
01:34:14,556 --> 01:34:16,225
Yes, and what I've done

920
01:34:16,325 --> 01:34:19,395
is taken the components from a
telephone answering system, actually,

921
01:34:19,495 --> 01:34:22,063
to convert the written text
into synthesized speech.

922
01:34:22,163 --> 01:34:25,861
I mean, the voice sounds
a little bit robotic, but...

923
01:34:25,961 --> 01:34:27,204
shall we give it a try?

924
01:34:27,304 --> 01:34:29,443
- Great.
- Here's the clicker.

925
01:34:33,243 --> 01:34:34,930
Right hand?

926
01:34:41,184 --> 01:34:43,022
There you go.

927
01:34:45,222 --> 01:34:47,463
Welcome to the future.

928
01:34:56,901 --> 01:34:58,728
It's American.

929
01:34:58,928 --> 01:35:00,706
Is that a problem?

930
01:35:00,806 --> 01:35:04,210
Oh, my goodness.
Well, is there another voice?

931
01:35:05,655 --> 01:35:07,645
That's the only one
they have at the moment.

932
01:35:07,745 --> 01:35:09,821
I think it's great.

933
01:35:53,728 --> 01:35:57,869
<i>Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.</i>

934
01:36:02,069 --> 01:36:04,147
<i>Exterminate.</i>

935
01:36:04,538 --> 01:36:06,477
<i>Exterminate.</i>

936
01:36:08,377 --> 01:36:09,686
<i>Exterminate.</i>

937
01:36:18,486 --> 01:36:20,625
<i>I will write a book.</i>

938
01:36:22,590 --> 01:36:24,501
About what?

939
01:36:31,534 --> 01:36:33,036
Time.

940
01:36:43,081 --> 01:36:45,584
<i>What is the nature of time?</i>

941
01:36:46,184 --> 01:36:48,920
<i>Will it ever come to an end?</i>

942
01:36:53,224 --> 01:36:56,727
<i>Someday, these answers
may seem as obvious to us</i>

943
01:36:56,827 --> 01:36:59,332
<i>as the Earth orbiting the sun,</i>

944
01:37:00,432 --> 01:37:04,673
<i>or perhaps as ridiculous
as a tower of tortoises.</i>

945
01:37:07,473 --> 01:37:12,399
<i>Only time, whatever that may be,
will tell.</i>

946
01:37:34,801 --> 01:37:36,498
Professor?

947
01:37:47,681 --> 01:37:51,292
- <i>It is for a friend.</i>
- Of course it is.

948
01:37:51,392 --> 01:37:53,804
That's what they all say.

949
01:37:54,602 --> 01:37:57,826
You don't have to be embarrassed
in front of me, Professor.

950
01:37:58,126 --> 01:38:00,030
I know what men are like.

951
01:38:01,630 --> 01:38:03,097
Shall we take a look?

952
01:38:04,833 --> 01:38:06,405
There you go.

953
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:20,911
Oh! I'm sorry.

954
01:38:31,028 --> 01:38:32,847
Next one?

955
01:38:38,402 --> 01:38:39,855
What?

956
01:39:21,515 --> 01:39:26,988
<i>So I said, "I have long been looking
for a model of the universe.</i>

957
01:39:28,088 --> 01:39:30,964
<i>"I finally found her."</i>

958
01:39:32,926 --> 01:39:34,908
I bet you did.

959
01:39:41,601 --> 01:39:44,906
Stephen, I need to steal you.
The contract's arrived.

960
01:39:45,006 --> 01:39:47,398
Could you just give us
a minute, please, Jane?

961
01:39:59,320 --> 01:40:01,163
There we go.

962
01:40:09,232 --> 01:40:10,853
Like new.

963
01:40:39,830 --> 01:40:41,067
"Who are we?

964
01:40:42,467 --> 01:40:44,169
"Why are we here?

965
01:40:44,269 --> 01:40:48,440
"If we ever learn this, it will be
the ultimate triumph of human reason,

966
01:40:48,540 --> 01:40:51,463
"for then we would know
the mind of God."

967
01:40:52,811 --> 01:40:54,722
Do you mean this?

968
01:40:55,145 --> 01:40:56,691
<i>Yes.</i>

969
01:40:58,684 --> 01:41:02,088
- <i>Of course.</i>
- So, you're acknowledging him?

970
01:41:07,493 --> 01:41:08,570
<i>However...</i>

971
01:41:11,997 --> 01:41:13,913
"However" what?

972
01:41:20,607 --> 01:41:23,930
Are you actually going to
let me have this moment?

973
01:41:28,914 --> 01:41:31,124
<i>You are welcome.</i>

974
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:14,127
<i>I have asked Elaine
to travel with me to America.</i>

975
01:42:16,965 --> 01:42:19,704
<i>She will look after me.</i>

976
01:42:33,017 --> 01:42:34,725
Will she?

977
01:42:38,221 --> 01:42:39,763
<i>Yes.</i>

978
01:42:46,163 --> 01:42:49,508
You always used to tell me
when an invitation came in.

979
01:42:51,736 --> 01:42:55,593
<i>Another award. What can you do?</i>

980
01:43:06,018 --> 01:43:08,097
<i>I am sorry.</i>

981
01:43:17,397 --> 01:43:19,947
<i>How many years?</i>

982
01:43:25,906 --> 01:43:27,474
They said two.

983
01:43:30,579 --> 01:43:32,888
You've had so many.

984
01:44:00,241 --> 01:44:02,978
<i>Everything will be okay.</i>

985
01:44:20,997 --> 01:44:23,338
I have loved you.

986
01:44:32,643 --> 01:44:35,232
I did my best.

987
01:45:13,187 --> 01:45:14,928
Careful.

988
01:45:15,455 --> 01:45:18,658
- That... That's staying.
- All right.

989
01:46:04,274 --> 01:46:06,075
Bye, Jonathan.

990
01:47:34,436 --> 01:47:36,819
Professor, I love your book!

991
01:47:43,745 --> 01:47:45,582
<i>Thank you.</i>

992
01:47:47,383 --> 01:47:50,973
<i>I first met the Professor</i>

993
01:47:51,754 --> 01:47:53,589
<i>in 1963.</i>

994
01:47:53,889 --> 01:47:57,360
<i>Now there you are.
Time! Where does it go?</i>

995
01:47:58,060 --> 01:48:02,812
<i>It has been one of the great joys
of my life to watch this man</i>

996
01:48:02,912 --> 01:48:08,702
<i>defy every expectation,
both scientific and personal.</i>

997
01:48:09,105 --> 01:48:13,377
<i>Please welcome onto the stage
my esteemed colleague,</i>

998
01:48:14,177 --> 01:48:17,713
<i>my dear friend, Professor Hawking.</i>

999
01:48:34,266 --> 01:48:39,610
<i>Thank you. Could we please have the first
pre-selected question? Thank you.</i>

1000
01:48:45,010 --> 01:48:47,135
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1001
01:48:50,415 --> 01:48:52,785
Now you are recognized everywhere.

1002
01:48:53,185 --> 01:48:55,489
How do you deal with all the attention?

1003
01:48:55,689 --> 01:48:59,492
<i>I was stopped recently
by a tourist in Cambridge,</i>

1004
01:48:59,592 --> 01:49:02,596
<i>who asked if I was
the real Stephen Hawking.</i>

1005
01:49:03,496 --> 01:49:07,937
<i>I replied I was not and said the
real one was much better looking.</i>

1006
01:49:11,238 --> 01:49:15,648
In 1979, you talked about the possibility
of a theory of everything

1007
01:49:15,748 --> 01:49:18,308
being discovered before
the end of the century.

1008
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:22,588
<i>I now predict that I was wrong.</i>

1009
01:49:26,988 --> 01:49:31,660
Professor Hawking, you have said
you do not believe in God.

1010
01:49:32,660 --> 01:49:36,072
Do you have a philosophy
of life that helps you?

1011
01:50:38,797 --> 01:50:41,501
You have said you do not believe in God.

1012
01:50:43,301 --> 01:50:46,513
Do you have a philosophy
of life that helps you?

1013
01:51:09,163 --> 01:51:12,993
<i>It is clear that we are just
an advanced breed of primates</i>

1014
01:51:13,093 --> 01:51:17,471
<i>on a minor planet orbiting around
a very average star</i>

1015
01:51:17,571 --> 01:51:22,910
<i>in the outer suburb
of one among 100 billion galaxies.</i>

1016
01:51:24,010 --> 01:51:25,680
<i>But,</i>

1017
01:51:25,780 --> 01:51:28,545
<i>ever since the dawn of civilization,</i>

1018
01:51:28,645 --> 01:51:34,224
<i>people have craved for an understanding
of the underlying order of the world.</i>

1019
01:51:35,224 --> 01:51:37,792
<i>There ought to be
something very special</i>

1020
01:51:37,892 --> 01:51:41,964
<i>about the boundary conditions
of the universe.</i>

1021
01:51:42,164 --> 01:51:46,939
<i>And what can be more special
than that there is no boundary...</i>

1022
01:51:48,839 --> 01:51:53,076
<i>And there should be no boundary
to human endeavor.</i>

1023
01:51:54,376 --> 01:51:56,745
<i>We are all different.</i>

1024
01:51:56,845 --> 01:51:58,981
<i>However bad life may seem,</i>

1025
01:51:59,081 --> 01:52:03,822
<i>there is always something
you can do and succeed at.</i>

1026
01:52:04,122 --> 01:52:08,091
<i>While there is life, there is hope.</i>

1027
01:52:28,313 --> 01:52:29,929
That came.

1028
01:52:39,859 --> 01:52:41,922
It's from Stephen.

1029
01:52:48,333 --> 01:52:50,000
Gosh.

1030
01:53:09,223 --> 01:53:12,374
Your glasses are always dirty.

1031
01:53:29,512 --> 01:53:32,779
Professor and Mrs. Hawking,
Her Majesty the Queen.

1032
01:54:03,381 --> 01:54:05,471
Congratulations...

1033
01:54:06,616 --> 01:54:09,955
My Companion of Honour.

1034
01:54:11,255 --> 01:54:14,208
Not bad for an old liberal socialist.

1035
01:54:15,592 --> 01:54:19,474
Don't worry,
you can decline the knighthood.

1036
01:54:29,174 --> 01:54:32,043
Thank you, for today.

1037
01:54:32,643 --> 01:54:34,611
It was extraordinary.

1038
01:54:35,582 --> 01:54:38,971
It's all been rather
extraordinary though, hasn't it?

1039
01:54:47,227 --> 01:54:49,124
What are you writing?

1040
01:55:00,741 --> 01:55:04,852
<i>Look what we made.</i>
