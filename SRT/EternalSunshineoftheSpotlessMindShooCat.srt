Hi, Cindy. It's Joel.

11
00:02:26,932 --> 00:02:29,477
Listen, I don't feel
very well today.

12
00:02:30,561 --> 00:02:32,396
No, food poisoning,
I think.

I'm sorry?
I just said hi.

Hi, hello.

31
00:05:09,553 --> 00:05:11,347
Okay if I sit closer?

32
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:15,684
How far are you going?

33
00:05:16,227 --> 00:05:17,874
Rockville Center.

34
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:19,522
Get out. Me, too.

35
00:05:20,022 --> 00:05:21,030
Really?

36
00:05:21,065 --> 00:05:22,066
What are the odds?

37
00:05:24,902 --> 00:05:26,737
Listen, do I know you?

38
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,992
Do you ever shop
at Barnes and Noble?

39
00:05:32,027 --> 00:05:33,209
Sure.

40
00:05:33,244 --> 00:05:34,849
That's it!
Yeah?

41
00:05:34,884 --> 00:05:36,455
I've seen you, man.

42
00:05:37,081 --> 00:05:40,793
Book slave there
for five years now.

43
00:05:41,377 --> 00:05:42,468
Jesus!

44
00:05:42,503 --> 00:05:44,588
I would have thought
I would remember you.

45
00:05:44,623 --> 00:05:46,507
It might be the hair.

46
00:05:46,542 --> 00:05:47,556
What might?

47
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:49,426
It changes a lot,
the color.

48
00:05:49,677 --> 00:05:51,929
That's why you might
not recognize me.

49
00:05:52,096 --> 00:05:54,160
It's called Blue Ruin.
Right.

50
00:05:54,195 --> 00:05:56,225
The color.
Snappy name, huh?

51
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,434
I like it.

52
00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:04,400
This company makes
a whole line of colors
with equally snappy names.

53
00:06:04,435 --> 00:06:07,987
You've got Red Menace,
Yellow Fever,
Green Revolution.

54
00:06:09,113 --> 00:06:11,761
That would be a job,
coming up with those names.

55
00:06:11,796 --> 00:06:14,980
You think there could
possibly be a job like that?

56
00:06:15,015 --> 00:06:18,164
I mean, how many hair colors
could there be? 15 maybe?

57
00:06:18,581 --> 00:06:20,541
Someone's got that job.

58
00:06:21,542 --> 00:06:24,170
Agent Orange.
I came up with that one.

59
00:06:25,337 --> 00:06:27,756
I apply my personality
in a paste.

60
00:06:28,257 --> 00:06:30,050
I doubt that very much.

61
00:06:31,177 --> 00:06:35,222
Well, you don't know me,
so you don't know, do you?

62
00:06:38,767 --> 00:06:42,396
I'm sorry.
I was just trying to be nice.

63
00:06:44,106 --> 00:06:45,900
Yeah. I got it.

64
00:07:05,628 --> 00:07:07,505
My name's Clementine,
by the way.

65
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,672
I'm Joel.

66
00:07:09,173 --> 00:07:10,424
Hi, Joel.

67
00:07:11,801 --> 00:07:13,559
No jokes about my name.

68
00:07:13,594 --> 00:07:15,846
Oh, no.
You wouldn't do that.

69
00:07:15,881 --> 00:07:17,556
You're trying to be nice.

70
00:07:18,182 --> 00:07:20,684
I don't know any jokes
about your name.

71
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:22,353
Huckleberry Hound.

72
00:07:23,938 --> 00:07:25,863
I don't know
what that means.

73
00:07:25,898 --> 00:07:28,567
Huckleberry Hound?
What are you, nuts?

74
00:07:28,734 --> 00:07:30,486
It's been suggested.

75
00:07:30,736 --> 00:07:34,198
O£, my darling, o£, my darling
O£, my darling Clementine

76
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:39,036
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

77
00:07:39,578 --> 00:07:40,628
No?

78
00:07:40,663 --> 00:07:42,039
I'm sorry.

79
00:07:42,832 --> 00:07:45,042
It's a pretty name, though.
It really is nice.

80
00:07:45,077 --> 00:07:49,004
It means merciful, right?
Clemency?

81
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,514
Although it hardly fits.

82
00:07:51,549 --> 00:07:53,926
I'm a vindictive little bitch,
truth be told.

83
00:07:53,961 --> 00:07:56,018
I wouldn't think that
about you.

84
00:07:56,053 --> 00:07:58,264
Why wouldn't you think that
about me?

85
00:07:58,848 --> 00:08:00,349
I don't know.

86
00:08:04,353 --> 00:08:05,938
You seem nice.

87
00:08:06,397 --> 00:08:07,982
Now I'm nice?

88
00:08:08,607 --> 00:08:11,401
Oh, God, don't you know
any other adjectives?

89
00:08:11,436 --> 00:08:14,196
I don't need nice.
I don't need myself to be it

90
00:08:14,231 --> 00:08:16,157
and I don't need anybody
to be it at me.

91
00:08:16,192 --> 00:08:17,283
Okay.

92
00:08:23,456 --> 00:08:24,790
It's Joel, right?

93
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,168
Yes.

94
00:08:28,711 --> 00:08:30,504
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

95
00:08:31,255 --> 00:08:33,632
I'm a little
out of sorts today.

96
00:08:43,476 --> 00:08:45,192
My embarrassing admission

97
00:08:45,227 --> 00:08:47,771
is I really like
that you're nice right now.

98
00:08:49,565 --> 00:08:53,402
I can't tell
from one moment to the next
what I'm going to like,

99
00:08:53,437 --> 00:08:56,906
but right now
I'm glad you are.

100
00:09:05,581 --> 00:09:08,584
I have some stuff
that I probably should...

101
00:09:11,253 --> 00:09:13,923
I'm writing...
I'm sorry. Okay.

102
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,591
No.
Sure. That's okay.

103
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:20,638
Take care, then.

104
00:09:20,673 --> 00:09:21,722
Jesus.

105
00:09:37,404 --> 00:09:40,199
I could give you a ride
if you need.

106
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,284
It's cold.

107
00:09:42,952 --> 00:09:45,204
Yeah! Okay. It is frosty.

108
00:09:45,913 --> 00:09:47,922
You're not a stalker
or anything, right?

109
00:09:47,957 --> 00:09:50,835
I'm not a stalker.
You're the one
that talked to me, remember?

110
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,129
That is the oldest trick
in the stalker book.

111
00:09:53,164 --> 00:09:55,589
Really?
There's a stalker book?

112
00:09:58,467 --> 00:10:00,219
I've got to read that one.

113
00:10:05,307 --> 00:10:08,102
Look, I'm sorry
if I came off sort of nutso.

114
00:10:08,686 --> 00:10:10,027
I'm not really.

115
00:10:10,062 --> 00:10:13,232
That's okay.
I didn't think you were.

116
00:10:19,613 --> 00:10:21,782
Do you want
to have a drink?

117
00:10:22,032 --> 00:10:24,452
I have lots of drinks,
and I could...

118
00:10:27,121 --> 00:10:30,666
Never mind.
Sorry, that was stupid.
I'm embarrassed now.

119
00:10:30,701 --> 00:10:32,293
Good night, Joel.

120
00:10:52,188 --> 00:10:53,814
Two Blue Ruins.

121
00:10:56,108 --> 00:10:57,158
Thank you.

122
00:10:57,193 --> 00:10:58,486
Drink up, young man.

123
00:10:59,528 --> 00:11:02,490
It'll make
the whole seduction part
less repugnant.

124
00:11:06,202 --> 00:11:08,579
I'm just kidding!
Come on.

125
00:11:15,336 --> 00:11:17,713
You're kind of close-mouthed,
aren't you?

126
00:11:17,748 --> 00:11:18,839
I'm sorry.

127
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:23,427
You know, my life isn't
that interesting.

128
00:11:24,887 --> 00:11:27,306
I go to work, I come home.

129
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:30,559
I don't know what to say.

130
00:11:31,435 --> 00:11:33,395
You should read my journal.

131
00:11:34,104 --> 00:11:37,233
I mean, it's just blank.

132
00:11:37,775 --> 00:11:40,993
Really? Does that
make you sad or anxious?

133
00:11:41,028 --> 00:11:44,573
I'm always anxious,
thinking I'm not living
my life to the fullest.

134
00:11:44,608 --> 00:11:46,540
Taking advantage
of every possibility

135
00:11:46,575 --> 00:11:50,371
and making sure
I'm not wasting one second
of the little time I have.

136
00:11:50,406 --> 00:11:52,623
I think about that.
Yeah?

137
00:11:57,378 --> 00:11:59,171
You're really nice.

138
00:11:59,964 --> 00:12:02,383
God, I have to stop
saying that.

139
00:12:04,552 --> 00:12:07,138
I'm gonna marry you.
I know it.

140
00:12:09,932 --> 00:12:11,058
Okay.

141
00:12:16,063 --> 00:12:20,067
Joel, you should
come up to the Charles
with me sometime.

142
00:12:20,609 --> 00:12:22,528
It gets frozen
this time of year.

143
00:12:22,563 --> 00:12:24,530
That sounds scary.
Exactly.

144
00:12:25,531 --> 00:12:28,451
I'll pack a picnic,
a night picnic.

145
00:12:29,034 --> 00:12:30,953
Night picnics are different.

146
00:12:32,705 --> 00:12:34,373
That sounds good.

147
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,543
But I should go now.

148
00:12:38,961 --> 00:12:40,316
You should stay.

149
00:12:40,351 --> 00:12:41,672
No, I really have...

150
00:12:42,715 --> 00:12:44,508
I have to get up
so early and...

151
00:12:44,543 --> 00:12:46,673
I would like you
to call me.

152
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,804
Would you do that?
I'd like it.

153
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:49,805
Yes.

154
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:57,354
Wish me
a happy Valentine's Day
when you call.

155
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,106
That'd be nice.

156
00:13:40,231 --> 00:13:42,149
What took you so long?

157
00:13:42,184 --> 00:13:43,734
I just walked in.

158
00:13:45,236 --> 00:13:46,654
You miss me?

159
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,532
Oddly enough, I do.

160
00:13:50,825 --> 00:13:53,744
You said "I do."
I guess that means
we're married.

161
00:13:53,953 --> 00:13:55,329
I guess so.

162
00:13:55,955 --> 00:13:58,457
Tomorrow night?
Honeymoon on ice?

163
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,001
It's really solid
this time of year.

164
00:14:02,002 --> 00:14:04,588
I don't know.
Come on.

165
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,265
It's so beautiful.

166
00:14:15,683 --> 00:14:16,934
Isn't it?

167
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,690
Don't go too far.

168
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:26,819
Are you okay?

169
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,575
Oh, my ass!

170
00:14:34,994 --> 00:14:37,580
I think I should go back.
Come on!

171
00:14:37,615 --> 00:14:39,130
But what if it breaks?

172
00:14:39,165 --> 00:14:41,542
"What if?"
Do you really care
right now?

173
00:14:42,418 --> 00:14:44,044
Come here, please.

174
00:14:51,927 --> 00:14:54,305
Slidey-slidey.

175
00:14:54,763 --> 00:14:56,390
This looks good.

176
00:14:56,974 --> 00:14:58,434
Let me show you
this one thing.

177
00:14:58,469 --> 00:15:00,269
What are you doing?

178
00:15:02,897 --> 00:15:04,064
Come on.

179
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,447
Think I heard a crack.

180
00:15:11,947 --> 00:15:15,117
It's not going to crack.
Or break.

181
00:15:15,152 --> 00:15:16,577
It's so thick.

182
00:15:19,121 --> 00:15:21,874
Show me
which constellations
you know.

183
00:15:24,627 --> 00:15:26,504
I don't know any.

184
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,466
Show me which ones
you know.

185
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:31,467
Okay.

186
00:15:37,807 --> 00:15:39,183
There's Osidius.

187
00:15:39,475 --> 00:15:40,476
Where?

188
00:15:41,435 --> 00:15:43,062
Right there. See?

189
00:15:43,437 --> 00:15:45,648
A sort of a swoop
and a cross.

190
00:15:46,315 --> 00:15:48,150
Osidius the Emphatic.

191
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,945
You're full of shit, right?

192
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,781
No. Osidius, right there.

193
00:15:54,323 --> 00:15:56,075
Swoop and a cross.

194
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,827
Shut the fuck up!

195
00:16:12,466 --> 00:16:14,093
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

196
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:21,725
Sorry to wake you,
but we're here.

197
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,696
Can I come over
to your house,

198
00:16:34,864 --> 00:16:38,033
to sleep? I'm so tired.

199
00:16:39,785 --> 00:16:42,371
Okay. Yeah, sure.

200
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,874
Let me get my toothbrush.

201
00:17:07,688 --> 00:17:08,772
Yes?

202
00:17:09,523 --> 00:17:11,066
Can I help you?

203
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,235
What do you mean?

204
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:16,322
Can I help you
with something?

205
00:17:17,281 --> 00:17:18,365
No.

206
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,250
What are you doing here?

207
00:17:21,285 --> 00:17:23,996
I'm not really sure
what you're asking me.

208
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,209
Thanks.

209
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,451
We're looking for 150.

210
00:19:18,486 --> 00:19:19,785
What number is that?

211
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,245
I don't know
what number that is.

212
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,824
Jesus Christ.
You'd think they'd
light the number

213
00:19:23,859 --> 00:19:25,242
or at least put
a number on...

214
00:19:25,277 --> 00:19:26,660
Is that him?
I think so.

215
00:19:26,695 --> 00:19:28,287
Yeah, that's him.

216
00:19:28,788 --> 00:19:30,164
That's him.

217
00:19:45,012 --> 00:19:47,014
Hey, Joel.
Frank.

218
00:19:50,893 --> 00:19:52,061
Shit.

219
00:19:52,728 --> 00:19:56,607
Jesus. The only
Valentine's Day cards I get
are from my mother.

220
00:19:56,642 --> 00:19:58,567
How pathetic is that?

221
00:19:58,984 --> 00:20:02,196
You're lucky
you have Clementine.
She is way cool.

222
00:20:02,571 --> 00:20:05,199
You got any
big Valentine's Day plans
with her?

223
00:20:09,161 --> 00:20:10,336
No.

224
00:20:10,371 --> 00:20:13,582
It's only a day away.
Better make some
reservations or something.

225
00:20:13,617 --> 00:20:15,876
Don't want to end up
at Mickey D's, right?

226
00:20:15,911 --> 00:20:17,211
McRomance!

227
00:20:17,378 --> 00:20:19,943
You want some fries
with that shake?

228
00:20:19,978 --> 00:20:22,508
I have to go to sleep now,
Frank.

229
00:20:23,425 --> 00:20:24,510
It's 8:30.

230
00:20:53,247 --> 00:20:54,915
Patrick, stop it.

231
00:21:13,601 --> 00:21:15,478
Okay.

232
00:21:22,485 --> 00:21:24,403
Showtime at the Apollo.

233
00:21:36,665 --> 00:21:37,833
Quiet.

234
00:21:47,343 --> 00:21:48,969
Get it off your head.

235
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,474
Hey, Joel.
What's up?

236
00:21:54,934 --> 00:21:56,268
Hi, Frank.

237
00:22:01,857 --> 00:22:06,153
I only get Valentine's Day
cards from my mom.
How pathetic is that?

238
00:22:07,696 --> 00:22:10,199
You're lucky
you have Clementine, Joel.

239
00:22:10,491 --> 00:22:13,869
You got any
big Valentine's Day plans
with her?

240
00:22:15,162 --> 00:22:16,205
No.

241
00:22:16,664 --> 00:22:20,167
It's only a day away.
Better make
a reservation somewhere.

242
00:22:20,835 --> 00:22:23,129
Don't want to end up
at Mickey D's.

243
00:22:24,171 --> 00:22:25,888
Oh, no.
Yes.

244
00:22:25,923 --> 00:22:29,385
Valentine's Day
is three days away.
I want it resolved.

245
00:22:29,718 --> 00:22:31,685
I'm willing to be the one
to resolve it.

246
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,723
So I call her,
and she's changed
her number.

247
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:38,359
So I walked over
to Antic Attic
to get her something.

248
00:22:38,394 --> 00:22:42,022
I thought I'd go over to work,
give her an early Valentine.

249
00:22:43,983 --> 00:22:45,860
And you won't believe it.

250
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:49,572
She's there with this guy,

251
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:52,116
this really young guy.

252
00:22:52,575 --> 00:22:56,036
And she looks at me like
she doesn't even know
who I am.

253
00:22:56,704 --> 00:22:57,746
Excuse me?

254
00:22:58,747 --> 00:23:00,332
Can I help you
find something, sir?

255
00:23:04,336 --> 00:23:05,880
Hey, Clem-ato.

256
00:23:06,714 --> 00:23:09,758
Patrick! Baby boy!

257
00:23:13,137 --> 00:23:14,638
What are you doing here,
baby?

258
00:23:14,673 --> 00:23:16,063
Just came to surprise you.

259
00:23:16,098 --> 00:23:18,601
Let me know
if you need something, sir.

260
00:23:20,603 --> 00:23:21,729
How are you?

261
00:23:21,896 --> 00:23:24,231
Pretty good, pretty bored,
pretty tired.

262
00:23:25,232 --> 00:23:27,610
I so want
what's in your suit.
Good.

263
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,794
Why would she
do that to me?

264
00:23:48,881 --> 00:23:50,591
Does anybody want a joint?

265
00:23:51,133 --> 00:23:53,636
God, Rob, give it a rest.

266
00:23:53,803 --> 00:23:56,222
God, she's punishing me.
I know.

267
00:23:56,257 --> 00:23:58,606
For being honest.
It's horrible.

268
00:23:58,641 --> 00:24:00,705
I should just go
to her house.
No.

269
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,089
You don't want to go there,
man.

270
00:24:03,124 --> 00:24:05,439
Get off me. It's too...
Right.

271
00:24:05,898 --> 00:24:08,282
Yeah.
I don't want to
seem desperate.

272
00:24:08,317 --> 00:24:10,861
Joel, why don't you
just see this as a sign?

273
00:24:10,896 --> 00:24:13,239
Make a clean break. Right?

274
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:19,794
All right, Joel.

275
00:24:19,829 --> 00:24:22,706
Look, man, seriously,
here's the deal.

276
00:24:22,832 --> 00:24:25,543
Don't do that.
Rob, what are you doing?

277
00:24:25,668 --> 00:24:27,760
What's your
fucking suggestion?

278
00:24:27,795 --> 00:24:29,567
What's your brilliant,
reasoned solution?

279
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:31,340
You're making this
about our shit now?

280
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:32,681
This isn't about us.
I agree.

281
00:24:32,716 --> 00:24:35,803
It's not about us.
It's about Joel,
who's an adult, okay?

282
00:24:35,838 --> 00:24:37,680
Not Mama Carrie's kid.

283
00:24:39,682 --> 00:24:42,143
Why don't you go
do your laundry?

284
00:24:43,686 --> 00:24:45,729
That's great.
That's good.

285
00:24:58,117 --> 00:24:59,201
Okay.

286
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:07,550
What is it?
I don't know.

287
00:25:07,585 --> 00:25:10,171
It's some place
that does a thing.

288
00:25:22,933 --> 00:25:24,727
Good morning. Lacuna.

289
00:25:25,686 --> 00:25:29,064
No, I'm sorry.
That offer expired
after the New Year.

290
00:25:31,317 --> 00:25:34,028
Yeah, sure.
We can fit you in...

291
00:25:34,445 --> 00:25:35,696
How about on the 5th?

292
00:25:36,864 --> 00:25:38,456
That's a Wednesday.

293
00:25:38,491 --> 00:25:41,202
All right, great.
Could you spell that, please?

294
00:25:41,577 --> 00:25:44,246
Okay, and we'll need
a daytime phone number.

295
00:25:45,581 --> 00:25:48,125
Great. Have a nice day.
See you then.

296
00:25:48,751 --> 00:25:50,211
May I help you?

297
00:25:50,503 --> 00:25:52,630
I'm Joel Barish.
Excuse me?

298
00:25:53,547 --> 00:25:55,598
I'm Joel Barish.

299
00:25:55,633 --> 00:25:57,516
I have an appointment
with Doctor...

300
00:25:57,551 --> 00:26:00,971
Mierzwiak.
Here, can you please
fill this out?

301
00:26:01,006 --> 00:26:02,229
I just want to talk to him.

302
00:26:02,264 --> 00:26:04,099
You still need to
fill the form out, sir.

303
00:26:04,134 --> 00:26:05,810
All right.
Thank you.

304
00:26:08,354 --> 00:26:09,862
I don't have a pen.

305
00:26:09,897 --> 00:26:11,565
There's a pen right there.

306
00:26:13,067 --> 00:26:14,693
Good morning. Lacuna.

307
00:26:14,944 --> 00:26:16,925
Yeah, that offer,
that's done now.

308
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,906
That expired
after the New Year.

309
00:26:19,115 --> 00:26:20,533
Mr. Barish?

310
00:26:23,369 --> 00:26:25,086
How are we today?

311
00:26:25,121 --> 00:26:26,413
Not too good, actually.

312
00:26:27,706 --> 00:26:29,250
Oh, my God! Stan!

313
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:31,043
Sorry, I was just...

314
00:26:31,078 --> 00:26:32,211
I'm working.

315
00:26:35,506 --> 00:26:37,550
Here, Doctor.
Thank you.

316
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:41,637
You should not have seen this.
I apologize.

317
00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:49,145
This is a hoax, right?
I mean, this is Clem's...

318
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,980
I assure you, no.
No.

319
00:26:58,362 --> 00:27:00,614
There's no such thing as this.

320
00:27:01,574 --> 00:27:05,161
Look, our files are
confidential, Mr. Barish,

321
00:27:05,196 --> 00:27:07,121
so I can't show you evidence.

322
00:27:07,329 --> 00:27:08,796
Suffice it to say

323
00:27:08,831 --> 00:27:12,501
that Miss Kruczynski
was not happy

324
00:27:13,294 --> 00:27:15,045
and she wanted to move on.

325
00:27:15,671 --> 00:27:17,972
We provide that possibility.

326
00:27:18,007 --> 00:27:21,302
"Miss Kruczynski was not happy
and wanted to move on.

327
00:27:21,802 --> 00:27:24,013
"We provide that possibility."

328
00:27:24,847 --> 00:27:26,474
What the hell is that?

329
00:27:26,849 --> 00:27:29,393
I'm the nicest guy
she ever went out with.

330
00:27:29,428 --> 00:27:30,478
Fuck!

331
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,155
Rob, give it a rest!

332
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,489
It's okay.
It's all right.

333
00:27:35,524 --> 00:27:37,735
Carrie,
I am making a birdhouse.

334
00:27:40,821 --> 00:27:44,033
What can I say? You know,
Clementine's just like that.

335
00:27:44,068 --> 00:27:45,826
She's impulsive.

336
00:27:46,076 --> 00:27:49,205
She decided to
erase you almost as a lark.

337
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:54,627
A lark?

338
00:27:55,336 --> 00:27:58,506
Why did you do that?

339
00:28:02,051 --> 00:28:03,642
Don't. Wait.

340
00:28:03,677 --> 00:28:06,263
I'm sorry, Doctor,
he just barged right in here.

341
00:28:06,298 --> 00:28:07,813
Okay. I want it done.

342
00:28:07,848 --> 00:28:10,392
I told him pre-Valentine's Day
is our busy time...

343
00:28:10,427 --> 00:28:12,485
That's okay, Mary.

344
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,819
But there are
people waiting.

345
00:28:13,854 --> 00:28:16,405
Mr. Barish,
if you'd like to come inside.

346
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,734
If you'd
take care of Mrs. Woo.
Yes, of course.

347
00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:20,152
Goodbye, Mrs. Woo.

348
00:28:27,743 --> 00:28:30,954
The first thing we need
you to do, Mr. Barish,

349
00:28:30,989 --> 00:28:33,933
is to go home and collect
everything you own

350
00:28:33,968 --> 00:28:36,877
that has some association
with Clementine.

351
00:28:38,003 --> 00:28:39,338
Anything.

352
00:28:41,632 --> 00:28:43,516
We'll use these items

353
00:28:43,551 --> 00:28:47,263
to create a map of Clementine
in your brain, okay?

354
00:28:47,847 --> 00:28:51,475
We'll need photos,

355
00:28:51,934 --> 00:28:55,688
clothing, gifts,
books she may have bought you,

356
00:28:55,855 --> 00:28:59,817
CDs you may have bought
together, journal entries.

357
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,945
We want to empty your home,

358
00:29:03,612 --> 00:29:06,240
we want to empty your life
of Clementine.

359
00:29:06,949 --> 00:29:08,582
And after the mapping is done,

360
00:29:08,617 --> 00:29:11,954
our technicians
will do the erasing
in your home tonight.

361
00:29:12,163 --> 00:29:14,999
That way,
when you awake in the morning,

362
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:17,877
you'll find yourself
in your own bed

363
00:29:18,085 --> 00:29:22,047
as if nothing had happened,
a new life awaiting you.

364
00:29:26,802 --> 00:29:28,137
Wake up, buddy!

365
00:29:33,976 --> 00:29:35,936
I'm sorry, Mrs. Sobel.

366
00:29:36,228 --> 00:29:39,899
You can't have the procedure
done three times in one month.

367
00:29:40,649 --> 00:29:42,234
It's just not
our policy here.

368
00:29:42,485 --> 00:29:44,153
How are you today,
Mr. Barish?

369
00:29:44,904 --> 00:29:46,822
Hello, I'm right here.

370
00:29:47,573 --> 00:29:50,326
I know it's an emergency.
We'll do everything we can.

371
00:29:50,361 --> 00:29:51,959
We can fit you in
on March 1.

372
00:29:51,994 --> 00:29:54,789
Maybe you could
talk to the doctor and...

373
00:29:55,664 --> 00:29:57,749
All right,
so let's make
an appointment.

374
00:29:57,784 --> 00:30:00,353
What day would you like
to come in this week?

375
00:30:00,388 --> 00:30:02,922
Mr. Barish.
He's really busy
this afternoon.

376
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:06,383
Maybe tomorrow
would be better,
around 12:15.

377
00:30:06,418 --> 00:30:07,510
Can you do that?

378
00:30:08,135 --> 00:30:11,555
February is very busy for us
because of Valentine's Day.

379
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:22,858
This is Stan Fink, one
of our most experienced
and skilled technicians.

380
00:30:24,819 --> 00:30:27,071
He'll be handling
your case tonight.

381
00:30:27,106 --> 00:30:29,156
Great to meet you, Mr. Barish.

382
00:30:30,116 --> 00:30:31,957
My name is Joel Barish,

383
00:30:31,992 --> 00:30:35,579
and I'm here to erase
Clementine Kruczynski.

384
00:30:36,789 --> 00:30:40,835
Very good.
Now tell me about Clementine.

385
00:30:44,547 --> 00:30:47,758
I was living with this woman,
Naomi,

386
00:30:49,677 --> 00:30:50,886
a couple years ago.

387
00:30:51,095 --> 00:30:53,062
And my friends,
Rob and Carrie,

388
00:30:53,097 --> 00:30:54,932
invited us
to this party at the beach.

389
00:30:54,967 --> 00:30:56,183
I don't like parties.

390
00:30:56,308 --> 00:30:59,145
Naomi couldn't go,
but I went

391
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:02,523
and I met Clementine.

392
00:31:04,775 --> 00:31:06,033
I'm sorry.

393
00:31:06,068 --> 00:31:09,154
We'll start with
your most recent memories

394
00:31:09,189 --> 00:31:12,241
and work backwards from there,
more or less.

395
00:31:12,992 --> 00:31:15,911
There's an emotional core
to each of our memories,

396
00:31:15,946 --> 00:31:17,872
and when you eradicate
that core,

397
00:31:17,997 --> 00:31:20,541
it starts
its degradation process.

398
00:31:20,791 --> 00:31:22,800
By the time you wake up
in the morning,

399
00:31:22,835 --> 00:31:26,922
all the memories
we've targeted will have
withered and disappeared.

400
00:31:26,957 --> 00:31:29,008
As in a dream upon waking.

401
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:32,052
Is there any risk
of brain damage?

402
00:31:33,596 --> 00:31:36,995
Technically speaking,
the procedure is brain damage.

403
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:40,394
But it's on a par with
a night of heavy drinking.

404
00:31:41,103 --> 00:31:42,104
Nothing you'll miss.

405
00:31:44,064 --> 00:31:45,441
Comfortable?

406
00:31:46,025 --> 00:31:47,950
What we're doing here,
Mr. Barish,

407
00:31:47,985 --> 00:31:50,300
is actually creating a map
of your brain.

408
00:31:50,335 --> 00:31:52,580
Okay, let's get started.

409
00:31:52,615 --> 00:31:54,992
If we want to
get this procedure
underway tonight,

410
00:31:55,027 --> 00:31:56,417
we have some work to do.

411
00:31:56,452 --> 00:31:59,914
I want you to react
to these objects, Mr. Barish,
if you will.

412
00:32:03,751 --> 00:32:05,259
There's a good story
behind that...

413
00:32:05,294 --> 00:32:08,985
Actually, Mr. Barish, I'll get
a much better emotional
read-out

414
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:12,676
if you refrain from
any sort of verbal description
of the items.

415
00:32:12,711 --> 00:32:14,678
Just please try to
focus on the memories.

416
00:32:14,713 --> 00:32:16,013
I'm sorry.

417
00:32:18,933 --> 00:32:22,061
Healthy activity
up there again.
Healthy read-outs.

418
00:32:22,096 --> 00:32:23,437
Very good.

419
00:32:23,687 --> 00:32:25,272
Here's another object.

420
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,274
Next item.

421
00:32:31,153 --> 00:32:32,654
Potato head.

422
00:32:32,689 --> 00:32:34,156
Next item.

423
00:32:36,742 --> 00:32:38,702
Just focus
on the memories.

424
00:32:38,737 --> 00:32:41,080
Patrick, do me a favor.

425
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:44,632
Patrick,
do me a favor, will you?

426
00:32:44,667 --> 00:32:48,671
Can you check
the voltage regulator?
What have we got there?

427
00:32:48,706 --> 00:32:50,930
Voltage looks fine.
Really?

428
00:32:50,965 --> 00:32:53,676
I'm not wiping
as clean as I like here.

429
00:32:58,848 --> 00:33:02,316
Technically,
the procedure is brain damage.

430
00:33:02,351 --> 00:33:05,020
But it's on a par with
a night of heavy drinking.

431
00:33:05,055 --> 00:33:07,314
Check the connections, please.

432
00:33:09,608 --> 00:33:11,026
There you are.

433
00:33:16,991 --> 00:33:18,451
What am I...

434
00:33:19,285 --> 00:33:21,287
I don't understand
what I'm looking at.

435
00:33:21,322 --> 00:33:24,206
Why am I standing here...

436
00:33:24,241 --> 00:33:25,833
Oh, my God, deja vu.

437
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:31,220
This is so...
We should get started.

438
00:33:31,255 --> 00:33:33,632
If we want to
get the procedure
underway tonight,

439
00:33:33,667 --> 00:33:35,141
we have some work to do.

440
00:33:35,176 --> 00:33:37,636
I'm in my head already,
aren't I?

441
00:33:37,671 --> 00:33:38,971
I suppose so.

442
00:33:40,055 --> 00:33:41,682
This is about right.

443
00:33:41,932 --> 00:33:44,018
This is
what it would look like.

444
00:33:46,687 --> 00:33:47,855
Very good.

445
00:33:48,481 --> 00:33:51,150
We'll dispose
of these mementos
when we're done here.

446
00:33:51,185 --> 00:33:52,700
That way you won't
be confused later

447
00:33:52,735 --> 00:33:55,613
by their
unexplainable presence
in your home.

448
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,740
There we go. Patrick?

449
00:33:59,742 --> 00:34:01,035
Patrick?

450
00:34:01,952 --> 00:34:03,245
Patrick?

451
00:34:04,455 --> 00:34:06,046
Why are there
so many wires?

452
00:34:06,081 --> 00:34:08,209
Because we have
a lot of equipment.

453
00:34:08,542 --> 00:34:09,717
Does that help?

454
00:34:09,752 --> 00:34:12,463
Are you sure you set
that thing up properly?

455
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,680
How's that?
How are you today, Mr. Barish?

456
00:34:14,715 --> 00:34:17,092
There we are, Mr. Barish.
All right,
that's better.

457
00:34:17,127 --> 00:34:18,799
I don't know if I like this.

458
00:34:18,834 --> 00:34:20,403
I think I might
try this then.

459
00:34:20,438 --> 00:34:21,937
We're almost done now.

460
00:34:21,972 --> 00:34:24,391
Yourjournal.
That'll be invaluable.

461
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:29,271
"I met someone tonight.
I don't know what to do.

462
00:34:29,306 --> 00:34:31,774
"Her name is Clementine
and she's amazing."

463
00:34:32,817 --> 00:34:33,908
Jesus!

464
00:34:33,943 --> 00:34:36,779
What?
Come on, careful!
Step back!

465
00:34:37,446 --> 00:34:39,156
Just take it easy.

466
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:41,457
It's fine.

467
00:34:41,492 --> 00:34:42,952
Let's not roach the guy.

468
00:34:47,289 --> 00:34:48,881
All right.
We got that one.

469
00:34:48,916 --> 00:34:51,085
This place is sort of a dump,
don't you think?

470
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,878
It's an apartment, Patrick.

471
00:34:54,964 --> 00:34:57,424
Well,
not a dump then,
but sort of plain.

472
00:34:57,758 --> 00:34:58,717
Uninspired.

473
00:34:59,468 --> 00:35:01,762
And there's sort
of a stale smell.

474
00:35:03,556 --> 00:35:05,912
Can we just please
get through this?

475
00:35:05,947 --> 00:35:08,269
We've got
a long night ahead of us.

476
00:35:14,942 --> 00:35:17,278
This is the last time
I saw you.

477
00:35:33,127 --> 00:35:34,420
It's 3:00.

478
00:35:34,837 --> 00:35:39,049
I kind of,
sort of wrecked your car.

479
00:35:39,925 --> 00:35:42,636
Driving drunk.
It's pathetic.

480
00:35:43,846 --> 00:35:46,098
I was a little tipsy.

481
00:35:46,515 --> 00:35:47,933
Don't call me pathetic!

482
00:35:47,968 --> 00:35:49,143
It is pathetic.

483
00:35:49,602 --> 00:35:51,193
It's fucking irresponsible.

484
00:35:51,228 --> 00:35:52,903
You could have
killed somebody.

485
00:35:52,938 --> 00:35:56,323
Maybe you did kill somebody.
Should we turn on the news
and see?

486
00:35:56,358 --> 00:35:59,904
Should I check the grille
to see if there's
children or small animals?

487
00:35:59,939 --> 00:36:03,032
It's just a fucking dent.
You're like an old lady
or something.

488
00:36:03,067 --> 00:36:04,617
What are you like?

489
00:36:06,118 --> 00:36:08,829
A wino?
A "wino"? Jesus.

490
00:36:09,038 --> 00:36:12,333
Are you from the '50s
or something? A "wino"?

491
00:36:13,667 --> 00:36:15,342
Face it, Joely.

492
00:36:15,377 --> 00:36:19,215
You're freaked out because
I was out late without you.

493
00:36:19,882 --> 00:36:22,176
And in your little,
wormy brain,

494
00:36:22,426 --> 00:36:24,220
you're trying to figure out,

495
00:36:24,637 --> 00:36:26,931
"Did she fuck
someone tonight?"

496
00:36:28,182 --> 00:36:31,727
Now, see, Clem, I assume
you fucked someone tonight.

497
00:36:33,145 --> 00:36:35,606
Isn't that how
you get people
to like you?

498
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:48,327
I'm sorry, okay?

499
00:36:48,786 --> 00:36:51,080
Clem, I didn't mean it,
all right?

500
00:36:57,545 --> 00:36:59,922
Your keys.
I won't need them anymore.

501
00:37:02,258 --> 00:37:05,761
I was just angry or annoyed
or something. I don't know.

502
00:37:16,355 --> 00:37:17,565
Got it.

503
00:37:19,191 --> 00:37:20,901
Mary's coming over tonight.

504
00:37:22,278 --> 00:37:23,571
Just thought
you'd want to know.

505
00:37:23,946 --> 00:37:25,246
I like Mary.

506
00:37:25,281 --> 00:37:28,075
I like when she comes
to visit. I don't think
she likes me.

507
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,535
She likes you okay.

508
00:37:30,453 --> 00:37:33,205
So maybe I should invite
my girlfriend over.

509
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:34,644
I have a girlfriend now.

510
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:36,069
Do whatever you want.

511
00:37:36,104 --> 00:37:37,460
Did I tell you...

512
00:37:43,382 --> 00:37:45,426
Did I tell you
I have a new girlfriend?

513
00:37:45,461 --> 00:37:47,636
We gotta focus here,
Patrick.

514
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:49,770
The thing is,

515
00:37:49,805 --> 00:37:53,100
my situation is
a little weird.

516
00:37:53,642 --> 00:37:55,352
My girlfriend situation.

517
00:37:55,603 --> 00:37:57,062
I'm sure it is.

518
00:37:58,063 --> 00:37:59,565
You've got to be...

519
00:38:25,674 --> 00:38:27,467
Clem, let me drive you home.

520
00:38:27,502 --> 00:38:29,261
Get out of my face, faggot!

521
00:38:31,055 --> 00:38:33,808
Look at it out here!
It's all falling apart!

522
00:38:34,683 --> 00:38:36,477
I'm erasing you,
and I'm happy!

523
00:38:37,186 --> 00:38:38,854
You did it to me first!

524
00:38:39,355 --> 00:38:42,650
I can't believe
you did this to me!
God damn it!

525
00:38:44,026 --> 00:38:45,402
Did you hear me?

526
00:38:46,278 --> 00:38:48,322
By morning you'll be gone!

527
00:38:48,989 --> 00:38:52,034
The perfect ending
to this piece-of-shit story!

528
00:38:57,581 --> 00:39:00,584
Is there
something wrong with a girl
being attracted to me?

529
00:39:00,619 --> 00:39:03,462
Is that a problem?
No, I think it's funny.

530
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:07,049
Who do you think's
better-looking,
me or this guy?

531
00:39:07,084 --> 00:39:08,884
Patrick, let's focus, buddy.

532
00:39:09,301 --> 00:39:11,887
Remember that girl
we did last week?

533
00:39:11,922 --> 00:39:14,431
The one with the potatoes?

534
00:39:16,892 --> 00:39:18,192
That girl?

535
00:39:18,227 --> 00:39:19,812
Yeah, that's this guy's girl.

536
00:39:20,729 --> 00:39:22,481
Right, was.

537
00:39:23,774 --> 00:39:25,526
We took care of that.

538
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,739
I kind of fell in love
with her that night.

539
00:39:30,774 --> 00:39:33,409
What? You little fuck.

540
00:39:33,444 --> 00:39:34,500
What?

541
00:39:34,535 --> 00:39:36,537
She was unconscious, man.

542
00:39:36,912 --> 00:39:38,831
She was beautiful.

543
00:39:40,541 --> 00:39:43,085
I stole a pair of her panties,
as well.

544
00:39:46,046 --> 00:39:47,304
Jesus!

545
00:39:47,339 --> 00:39:49,946
What? It's not like...
I mean, they were
clean and all.

546
00:39:49,981 --> 00:39:52,622
Don't tell me this.
I don't want to hear
this shit.

547
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:55,295
They were clean.
What? Don't. Stop.

548
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:57,933
Okay, all right.
We've got work to do.

549
00:39:58,476 --> 00:39:59,935
Hold my papers.

550
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,120
There's more.

551
00:40:20,456 --> 00:40:25,669
After we did her,
I kind of asked her out.

552
00:40:27,755 --> 00:40:29,340
What?

553
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,549
Jesus.

554
00:40:36,889 --> 00:40:38,189
...how unethical...

555
00:40:38,224 --> 00:40:40,976
It's not really that bad.

556
00:40:41,811 --> 00:40:44,438
Get that look off your face.
What's wrong?

557
00:40:44,473 --> 00:40:47,066
Patrick,
you stole a girl's panties.

558
00:40:59,328 --> 00:41:01,122
There's someone here.

559
00:41:02,832 --> 00:41:04,542
He stole your underwear.

560
00:41:05,126 --> 00:41:06,836
I don't see anyone.

561
00:41:25,688 --> 00:41:28,190
Joel, where are my boots?

562
00:41:28,649 --> 00:41:30,860
Now, why are you
showing me poisons?

563
00:41:31,026 --> 00:41:33,132
Can't you understand English?

564
00:41:33,167 --> 00:41:35,239
Potions, I said. Potions.

565
00:41:42,121 --> 00:41:44,255
£ove potion, please.

566
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:47,710
I'm fucking
crawling out of my skin!

567
00:41:50,421 --> 00:41:53,132
I should have left you
at the flea market.

568
00:42:06,312 --> 00:42:07,730
Want to go?

569
00:42:08,898 --> 00:42:10,608
I want to have a baby.

570
00:42:12,067 --> 00:42:14,382
Let's talk about it later.

571
00:42:14,417 --> 00:42:16,697
No. I want to have a baby.

572
00:42:18,282 --> 00:42:20,367
I don't think we're ready.

573
00:42:21,285 --> 00:42:22,995
You're not ready.

574
00:42:24,205 --> 00:42:27,291
Clem, do you really think
you could take care of a kid?

575
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:29,293
What?

576
00:42:30,961 --> 00:42:32,546
I don't want to
talk about it here.

577
00:42:32,581 --> 00:42:33,721
I can't hear you.

578
00:42:33,756 --> 00:42:36,091
I can
never the fuck understand
what you're saying.

579
00:42:36,126 --> 00:42:37,968
I said I don't want to
talk about this!

580
00:42:38,003 --> 00:42:40,227
We're fucking gonna
talk about it!

581
00:42:40,262 --> 00:42:43,724
You can't just say that
and say you don't wanna
talk about it.

582
00:42:43,759 --> 00:42:45,935
I'm sorry.
I'd make
a fucking good mother.

583
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:47,401
I love children.

584
00:42:47,436 --> 00:42:50,981
I'm creative,
I'm smart, and I'd make
a fucking great mother!

585
00:42:51,016 --> 00:42:52,323
It's you, Joel.

586
00:42:52,358 --> 00:42:53,818
It's you who can't
commit to anything.

587
00:42:53,853 --> 00:42:54,992
It's going.

588
00:42:55,027 --> 00:42:57,078
You've no idea
how lucky you are
I'm interested in you.

589
00:42:57,113 --> 00:43:00,783
I don't even know why I am.
Maybe I should
end it right here!

590
00:43:00,818 --> 00:43:04,408
Leave you at the flea market
with the stupid
costume jewelry!

591
00:43:04,443 --> 00:43:07,998
Maybe you can find a nice
antique rocking chair
to die in!

592
00:43:17,133 --> 00:43:19,155
Hi, Patrick.
Hi, Mary, how's it going?

593
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:21,178
Hey, you.
It's freezing outside.

594
00:43:21,213 --> 00:43:22,471
Did you find us okay?

595
00:43:22,506 --> 00:43:23,430
Yeah.

596
00:43:28,394 --> 00:43:29,520
Hot.

597
00:43:31,397 --> 00:43:32,606
Poor guy.

598
00:43:35,651 --> 00:43:37,820
Don't you have
anything real to drink?

599
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:40,364
We haven't checked yet.

600
00:43:42,825 --> 00:43:44,535
Let me do the honors.

601
00:43:46,495 --> 00:43:47,955
Mary hates me.

602
00:43:48,414 --> 00:43:50,854
Never really had
much luck with the ladies.

603
00:43:50,889 --> 00:43:53,294
Maybe if you stopped
stealing their panties.

604
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,423
There's more.
No.

605
00:43:57,458 --> 00:43:58,674
Yes.
No.

606
00:44:03,512 --> 00:44:05,681
You didn't want any,
did you, Patrick?

607
00:44:05,716 --> 00:44:07,808
No, I don't know.
That's okay.

608
00:44:08,017 --> 00:44:10,609
Wait.
"Blessed are the forgetful,

609
00:44:10,644 --> 00:44:13,564
"for they get the better
even of their blunders."

610
00:44:24,366 --> 00:44:25,743
That's Nietzsche.

611
00:44:25,951 --> 00:44:28,746
Beyond Good and Evil.
I found it in my Bartlett's.

612
00:44:29,705 --> 00:44:31,665
What's your Bartlett's?

613
00:44:32,124 --> 00:44:33,626
It's a quote book, Patrick.

614
00:44:34,251 --> 00:44:35,885
It's a book of quotations.

615
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,547
I think Howard will be
in Bartlett's one day.

616
00:44:38,582 --> 00:44:40,382
Definitely.
Howard is pure Bartlett's.

617
00:44:44,386 --> 00:44:46,145
Can you wake him up?

618
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,556
You can't wake him up.

619
00:44:56,398 --> 00:44:58,692
You don't tell me things,
Joel.

620
00:45:00,402 --> 00:45:02,196
I'm an open book.

621
00:45:03,739 --> 00:45:05,199
I tell you everything.

622
00:45:05,491 --> 00:45:08,410
Every damn embarrassing thing.

623
00:45:11,497 --> 00:45:13,249
You don't trust me.

624
00:45:13,749 --> 00:45:17,044
Constantly talking isn't
necessarily communicating.

625
00:45:19,797 --> 00:45:21,382
I don't do that.

626
00:45:24,176 --> 00:45:26,053
I want to know you.

627
00:45:29,056 --> 00:45:32,017
I don't constantly talk.
Jesus.

628
00:45:34,145 --> 00:45:36,730
People have to share things,
Joel.

629
00:45:38,274 --> 00:45:40,234
That's what intimacy is.

630
00:45:41,026 --> 00:45:43,654
I'm really pissed
that you said that to me.

631
00:45:43,689 --> 00:45:44,989
I'm sorry.

632
00:45:46,282 --> 00:45:48,617
My life just isn't
that interesting.

633
00:45:49,452 --> 00:45:53,435
I wanna read
some of those journals you're
constantly scribbling in.

634
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:57,418
What do you write
if you don't have any thoughts
or passions or love?

635
00:46:04,884 --> 00:46:08,762
"November 19, 2003.

636
00:46:09,638 --> 00:46:11,891
"Dinner at Kang's again.

637
00:46:14,435 --> 00:46:16,854
"Are we like
those poor couples

638
00:46:17,938 --> 00:46:20,399
"you feel sorry for
in restaurants?

639
00:46:20,649 --> 00:46:22,651
"Are we the dining dead?"

640
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:27,531
I can't stand the idea
of us being a couple
people think that about.

641
00:46:31,827 --> 00:46:33,287
I like that.

642
00:46:36,415 --> 00:46:38,042
How's the chicken?

643
00:46:38,709 --> 00:46:39,794
Good.

644
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:43,964
More?
No, thank you.

645
00:46:47,009 --> 00:46:49,678
She's going to be drunk
and stupid now.

646
00:46:50,304 --> 00:46:53,933
Would you do me a favor
and clean the goddamn hair
off the soap

647
00:46:53,968 --> 00:46:55,559
when you're done
in the shower?

648
00:46:55,594 --> 00:46:57,269
It's really...
Yeah.

649
00:46:57,603 --> 00:46:59,313
It's gross.
Gross.

650
00:47:01,357 --> 00:47:04,193
I think it's just...
Repulsive.

651
00:47:04,228 --> 00:47:05,820
It's repulsive.

652
00:47:11,784 --> 00:47:13,994
Patrick,
can we get through this?

653
00:47:15,371 --> 00:47:16,789
Hey, Tangerine.

654
00:47:18,415 --> 00:47:20,042
Patrick, it's you.

655
00:47:21,252 --> 00:47:23,420
I'm so miserable right now.

656
00:47:24,213 --> 00:47:25,679
Why? What's wrong?

657
00:47:25,714 --> 00:47:28,968
I don't know. I'm just
confused about everything.

658
00:47:29,927 --> 00:47:31,178
Confused?

659
00:47:31,428 --> 00:47:34,390
What are you confused about?
Everything's fine.

660
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:43,983
Do you love me?

661
00:47:44,018 --> 00:47:45,241
Of course I do.

662
00:47:45,276 --> 00:47:47,111
Where's
the self-help section?

663
00:47:48,112 --> 00:47:49,780
Do you think I'm ugly?

664
00:47:49,815 --> 00:47:51,449
No. You're beautiful.

665
00:47:52,074 --> 00:47:55,411
Maybe I should come over.
No. I don't know.

666
00:47:55,703 --> 00:47:57,538
I'm a mess, Patrick.

667
00:47:58,998 --> 00:48:01,333
Just let me come over.
I'll cheer you up.

668
00:48:01,368 --> 00:48:02,460
Okay.

669
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:05,754
Can I leave for a while?
My girlfriend's really upset.

670
00:48:06,589 --> 00:48:09,216
We're right in the middle
of erasing this poor man's...

671
00:48:09,258 --> 00:48:11,677
Let him go, Stan.
I'll help.

672
00:48:13,262 --> 00:48:14,937
See?
How hard can it be?

673
00:48:14,972 --> 00:48:16,682
She hates me.
She wants me to go.

674
00:48:16,717 --> 00:48:17,850
Go.

675
00:48:19,018 --> 00:48:21,520
All right.
I'll be right over,
Tangerine.

676
00:48:21,555 --> 00:48:22,938
You like?

677
00:48:26,942 --> 00:48:29,111
I matched
my sweatshirt exactly.

678
00:48:29,146 --> 00:48:30,411
I like it.
You do?

679
00:48:30,446 --> 00:48:32,198
You look like a tangerine.

680
00:48:33,032 --> 00:48:35,451
Clementine the tangerine.

681
00:48:35,993 --> 00:48:37,745
Juicy and seedless.

682
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:38,829
I like that.

683
00:48:40,873 --> 00:48:42,875
I like tangerines.

684
00:48:43,793 --> 00:48:45,044
Can you see me
doing ducks?

685
00:48:45,169 --> 00:48:46,170
Tangerine.

686
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:49,799
How does he know
to call you that?

687
00:48:49,834 --> 00:48:51,258
How did who know?

688
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,427
Oh, my God. Clem?
This is pretty cool.

689
00:48:53,462 --> 00:48:55,843
That's what
they called themselves.

690
00:48:55,878 --> 00:48:58,189
The Clash,
the only band that mattered.

691
00:48:58,224 --> 00:49:00,476
And they called themselves
that for a reason.

692
00:49:00,511 --> 00:49:02,728
It's amazing, isn't it?
Like social justice.

693
00:49:02,763 --> 00:49:04,685
Yeah,
it's totally incredible.

694
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,607
What Howard
gives to the world.

695
00:49:08,317 --> 00:49:09,401
Yeah.

696
00:49:10,152 --> 00:49:12,154
To let people begin again.

697
00:49:14,406 --> 00:49:15,664
It's beautiful.

698
00:49:15,699 --> 00:49:19,161
You look at a baby,
and it's so pure and so free

699
00:49:19,196 --> 00:49:21,455
and so clean.

700
00:49:21,956 --> 00:49:24,750
Adults are this
mess of sadness

701
00:49:26,627 --> 00:49:28,170
and phobias.

702
00:49:28,337 --> 00:49:30,464
And Howard
just makes it all go away.

703
00:49:44,353 --> 00:49:45,688
Baby, what's going on?

704
00:49:45,723 --> 00:49:47,481
I don't know.

705
00:49:47,523 --> 00:49:51,193
I'm lost, I'm scared,
I feel like I'm disappearing.

706
00:49:51,485 --> 00:49:54,196
My skin's coming off!
I'm getting old!

707
00:49:54,231 --> 00:49:55,531
Nothing makes
any sense to me!

708
00:49:55,566 --> 00:49:57,842
You're not getting old.

709
00:49:57,877 --> 00:50:00,119
Nothing makes any sense.

710
00:50:00,244 --> 00:50:01,620
Tangerine.

711
00:50:04,999 --> 00:50:06,333
It's okay.

712
00:50:07,084 --> 00:50:09,253
Let's go out dancing.

713
00:50:09,753 --> 00:50:11,755
You want to go out
to Montauk with me?

714
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:13,055
Montauk?

715
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:15,008
No, come up
to Boston with me.

716
00:50:15,043 --> 00:50:17,799
Sure. We can go next weekend.

717
00:50:17,834 --> 00:50:20,521
No, now. I have to go now.

718
00:50:20,556 --> 00:50:22,558
I have to see
the frozen Charles now.

719
00:50:26,729 --> 00:50:28,105
Hi, it's Joel.

720
00:50:30,065 --> 00:50:34,487
£eave a message after the beep
and I'll get back to you.

721
00:50:35,988 --> 00:50:38,157
Pick up.

722
00:50:43,662 --> 00:50:45,831
Hello? What's up?

723
00:50:46,248 --> 00:50:48,799
I got into a little situation
with the old lady.

724
00:50:48,834 --> 00:50:51,837
Can you handle things tonight
alone? I'm really sorry.

725
00:50:52,129 --> 00:50:54,757
Don't worry about it.
I've got it under control.

726
00:50:54,792 --> 00:50:56,926
He's pretty much
on auto-pilot now, anyway.

727
00:50:56,961 --> 00:50:58,594
Thanks.
I owe you big-time.

728
00:50:58,629 --> 00:51:00,012
Dude, I got to go.

729
00:51:13,984 --> 00:51:16,660
"Look. You and me
on the Charles River.

730
00:51:16,695 --> 00:51:19,657
"I could die right now, Clem.
I'm just happy.

731
00:51:20,116 --> 00:51:23,369
"I've never felt that before.
I'm exactly where I want..."

732
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:26,267
I'm so excited.

733
00:51:26,302 --> 00:51:27,915
I'm excited, too.

734
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:29,083
Cool.

735
00:51:32,461 --> 00:51:35,798
I got you this thing.

736
00:51:37,424 --> 00:51:40,386
Happy early Valentine's Day.
Thank you.

737
00:51:44,098 --> 00:51:45,599
What is it?

738
00:51:45,641 --> 00:51:47,059
I don't know. Open it up.

739
00:51:54,859 --> 00:51:56,492
It's gorgeous.

740
00:51:56,527 --> 00:51:59,113
You like it?
It's just my taste, really.

741
00:51:59,655 --> 00:52:03,534
God, I've never gone out
with a guy who bought
me jewelry I liked.

742
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:05,953
Thank you.

743
00:52:13,878 --> 00:52:15,212
Let's go.
Okay.

744
00:52:15,504 --> 00:52:18,507
Joely?
Yeah, Tangerine?

745
00:52:20,176 --> 00:52:21,469
Am I ugly?

746
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,307
When I was a kid,
I thought I was.

747
00:52:28,017 --> 00:52:30,436
Can't believe
I'm crying already.

748
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:32,737
Sometimes I think

749
00:52:32,772 --> 00:52:35,941
people don't understand
how lonely it is to be a kid.

750
00:52:36,734 --> 00:52:38,944
Like you don't matter.

751
00:52:41,322 --> 00:52:42,788
So, I'm eight,

752
00:52:42,823 --> 00:52:46,202
and I have these toys,
these dolls.

753
00:52:47,161 --> 00:52:51,373
My favorite
is this ugly girl doll
who I call Clementine.

754
00:52:52,333 --> 00:52:54,210
And I keep yelling at her,

755
00:52:54,376 --> 00:52:57,129
"You can't be ugly.
Be pretty."

756
00:52:58,422 --> 00:53:01,717
It's weird.
Like if I can transform her,

757
00:53:03,594 --> 00:53:05,846
I would magically
change, too.

758
00:53:11,393 --> 00:53:12,853
You're pretty.

759
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:16,127
Don't ever leave me.

760
00:53:16,162 --> 00:53:17,525
You're pretty.

761
00:53:20,861 --> 00:53:24,115
Mierzwiak, please
let me keep this memory.

762
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:25,366
Just this one.

763
00:53:26,408 --> 00:53:28,828
I don't want
to hold your hand. Come on.

764
00:53:32,748 --> 00:53:33,958
Stop it!

765
00:53:36,502 --> 00:53:38,420
I could die right now.

766
00:53:40,756 --> 00:53:44,927
I'm just so happy.

767
00:53:48,431 --> 00:53:50,558
I've never felt
that before.

768
00:53:53,894 --> 00:53:55,604
I'm just exactly

769
00:53:58,691 --> 00:54:00,359
where I want to be.

770
00:54:09,994 --> 00:54:13,414
I want to call it off.
I'll give you a sign.

771
00:54:19,211 --> 00:54:21,088
I want to call it off.

772
00:54:22,882 --> 00:54:27,178
Can you hear me?
I don't want this anymore!
I want to call it off!

773
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:36,812
Is anybody there?

774
00:54:54,163 --> 00:54:56,297
What?
We've got to go.

775
00:54:56,332 --> 00:54:59,460
Where?
I have an idea
of how to stop this.

776
00:54:59,495 --> 00:55:00,711
Stop what?

777
00:55:06,509 --> 00:55:08,476
Don't tickle me. No.

778
00:55:08,511 --> 00:55:10,346
Smell my pits!

779
00:55:11,347 --> 00:55:13,015
Concentrate, Clem.

780
00:55:14,183 --> 00:55:16,748
We have to get back
to the office.
Halloween.

781
00:55:16,783 --> 00:55:19,313
There was a tape recorder.
No, not the picture.

782
00:55:22,399 --> 00:55:24,110
Back here. Come on.

783
00:55:24,819 --> 00:55:27,822
Look at me.
I want to go there.

784
00:55:27,863 --> 00:55:32,284
Our files are confidential,
so I can't show you evidence.

785
00:55:32,868 --> 00:55:36,455
Suffice it to say
that Miss Kruczynski

786
00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:40,042
was not happy
and she wanted to move on.

787
00:55:41,502 --> 00:55:42,885
Tell me about...

788
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:46,090
Tell me
everything you remember.
That's what he said.

789
00:55:46,125 --> 00:55:48,099
What did we
see that day?

790
00:55:48,134 --> 00:55:51,929
We're going to see
my grandma.
Shit!

791
00:55:52,346 --> 00:55:54,598
Joel, why...
No. We're not
going on a train.

792
00:55:54,633 --> 00:55:56,851
Joel, please.
Don't make me run anymore.

793
00:55:56,886 --> 00:55:58,185
Come on.

794
00:55:58,227 --> 00:55:59,186
Mierzwiak!

795
00:56:00,479 --> 00:56:02,606
Do we always have to run?

796
00:56:13,242 --> 00:56:14,368
Please?

797
00:56:15,578 --> 00:56:20,291
Why don't we begin by
you telling me everything
you can remember...

798
00:56:20,326 --> 00:56:23,085
Mierzwiak,
wake me up!

799
00:56:25,004 --> 00:56:29,175
I'm sorry, Mr. Barish,
I thought you understood
what was going on.

800
00:56:30,134 --> 00:56:33,846
You're erasing her from me.
You're erasing me from her.

801
00:56:39,602 --> 00:56:42,730
You got this thing.
I'm in my bed. I know it.

802
00:56:43,773 --> 00:56:45,156
I'm in my brain.

803
00:56:45,191 --> 00:56:48,381
I'm part of
your imagination, too.

804
00:56:48,416 --> 00:56:51,537
How can I help
you from there?

805
00:56:51,572 --> 00:56:54,408
I'm inside your head, too.
I'm you.

806
00:56:57,453 --> 00:56:58,746
Sorry.

807
00:56:58,788 --> 00:57:00,331
Look, who's that?

808
00:57:00,831 --> 00:57:04,209
He works for us.

809
00:57:04,244 --> 00:57:07,588
That's Patrick,

810
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,757
baby boy.

811
00:57:10,299 --> 00:57:13,928
He's stealing my identity.
He stole my stuff.

812
00:57:15,513 --> 00:57:18,974
He's seducing my girlfriend
with my words and my things.

813
00:57:19,009 --> 00:57:20,893
He stole her underwear.

814
00:57:21,685 --> 00:57:24,271
Jesus Christ.
He stole her underwear.

815
00:57:25,606 --> 00:57:27,274
I could die right now, Clem.

816
00:57:27,817 --> 00:57:28,818
I'm just happy.

817
00:57:30,444 --> 00:57:32,113
I've never felt that before.

818
00:57:32,613 --> 00:57:34,240
I'm exactly
where I want to be.

819
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:38,369
I want to go home.

820
00:57:40,496 --> 00:57:41,580
What?

821
00:57:47,586 --> 00:57:48,963
Wait, Clem.

822
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:54,009
Clem, they're erasing you.

823
00:57:55,386 --> 00:57:56,720
Over here!

824
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:58,931
Clem, focus.

825
00:57:59,098 --> 00:58:01,976
I hired them, okay?
I'm sorry. I'm so stupid.

826
00:58:02,017 --> 00:58:05,020
Sweetie, calm down.
Enjoy the scenery.

827
00:58:05,229 --> 00:58:08,691
I need it to stop
before I wake up
and don't know you anymore.

828
00:58:12,027 --> 00:58:13,988
Just tell them
to cancel it then.

829
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:16,240
What the hell are you
talking about?

830
00:58:16,407 --> 00:58:17,992
I can't just cancel it.
I'm asleep.

831
00:58:18,868 --> 00:58:20,334
Wake yourself up!

832
00:58:20,369 --> 00:58:22,503
Okay, you want me to wake up?
All right.

833
00:58:22,538 --> 00:58:24,999
Okay, here we go.
Will it make you happy
if I try?

834
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:26,674
Yeah.
I'll try really hard.

835
00:58:26,709 --> 00:58:29,170
Here we go.
That was a great idea.

836
00:58:31,881 --> 00:58:34,091
That's working
like gangbusters.

837
00:58:34,884 --> 00:58:37,219
Don't!
That tickles me!

838
00:58:38,804 --> 00:58:41,307
What the hell is that?
It's a birthmark!

839
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:46,562
It did work, for a second.

840
00:58:47,897 --> 00:58:49,523
But I couldn't...
See?

841
00:58:49,565 --> 00:58:51,108
I couldn't move.

842
00:58:52,276 --> 00:58:55,404
Isn't that just another one
of Joel's self-fulfilling
prophecies?

843
00:58:55,439 --> 00:58:58,032
It's more important
to prove me wrong
than to actually...

844
00:58:58,067 --> 00:59:01,035
I don't want to discuss this
right now, okay?

845
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:02,161
Fine.

846
00:59:04,330 --> 00:59:07,541
Then what? I'm listening.

847
00:59:07,583 --> 00:59:09,717
I don't know.
You erased me.

848
00:59:09,752 --> 00:59:12,338
That's why I'm here
and doing this.

849
00:59:12,463 --> 00:59:16,217
I'm sorry.
You know me, I'm impulsive.

850
00:59:20,554 --> 00:59:22,723
That's what I love about you.

851
00:59:28,896 --> 00:59:31,398
I have another idea
for this problem.

852
00:59:31,607 --> 00:59:33,400
This is a memory of me.

853
00:59:33,442 --> 00:59:35,903
The way you wanted
to have sex on the couch

854
00:59:35,945 --> 00:59:38,322
after you look down
at my crotch.

855
00:59:39,698 --> 00:59:41,826
The eraser guys are coming,

856
00:59:42,201 --> 00:59:44,328
so what if you take me
somewhere else,

857
00:59:44,363 --> 00:59:46,038
somewhere where
I don't belong,

858
00:59:46,455 --> 00:59:47,915
and we hide there
till morning?

859
00:59:54,964 --> 00:59:57,216
I can't remember anything
without you.

860
00:59:58,425 --> 01:00:01,137
That's very sweet,
but try, okay?
Okay.

861
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:13,774
Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream

862
01:00:14,775 --> 01:00:18,404
Merrily, merrily,
merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream

863
01:00:27,163 --> 01:00:30,458
It's working.
I'm a genius.

864
01:00:58,569 --> 01:01:00,196
Where did you go?

865
01:01:00,821 --> 01:01:02,830
I'm supposed to come, too!

866
01:01:02,865 --> 01:01:04,457
I'm just gonna go
get a salad bowl.

867
01:01:04,492 --> 01:01:06,285
Can you stir the soup
and keep an eye on Joel?

868
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:07,991
He likes to be near me.

869
01:01:08,026 --> 01:01:09,663
Absolutely.

870
01:01:10,247 --> 01:01:13,793
It worked.
My God, look at this.

871
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:16,587
It worked!

872
01:01:17,254 --> 01:01:18,798
Look at this dress, man.

873
01:01:20,549 --> 01:01:21,759
I wish I could
take it with me.

874
01:01:24,303 --> 01:01:26,430
Who am I?
Mrs. Hamlyn.

875
01:01:26,555 --> 01:01:27,730
Right. Mrs. Hamlyn.

876
01:01:27,765 --> 01:01:30,434
I must be about four.
Oh, my gosh.

877
01:01:30,851 --> 01:01:34,146
Found the salad bowl.
I'm serving salad
and string beans.

878
01:01:34,181 --> 01:01:37,066
Is he okay under there?
Honey, are you all right?

879
01:01:37,101 --> 01:01:39,325
I feel like
I could clean up all day.

880
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:42,279
Would you hate me
if I asked you to clean
some string beans?

881
01:01:42,314 --> 01:01:45,407
No, not at all.
God, I love this kitchen.

882
01:01:45,741 --> 01:01:47,409
Thank you so much.

883
01:01:47,827 --> 01:01:50,329
She's not looking at me.
She's busy.

884
01:01:52,373 --> 01:01:55,584
No one ever looks at me.
I want my mommy.

885
01:01:55,835 --> 01:01:57,336
Oh, baby Joel.

886
01:01:58,587 --> 01:02:00,673
Is every little peanut
under there okay?

887
01:02:00,708 --> 01:02:02,014
He's fine.

888
01:02:02,049 --> 01:02:03,808
Do you have
something to drink?

889
01:02:03,843 --> 01:02:06,387
How about a cocktail?
I know it's not 5:00...

890
01:02:06,422 --> 01:02:07,561
I would die for a vodka.

891
01:02:07,596 --> 01:02:09,146
Let me check
if I have that.

892
01:02:09,181 --> 01:02:11,016
Okay, I'm just going
to wait right here.

893
01:02:11,051 --> 01:02:14,068
No, sweetie. Joely?

894
01:02:14,103 --> 01:02:17,356
Your mother
wants me to mind you.
Get back under the table.

895
01:02:17,391 --> 01:02:18,447
Ice cream.

896
01:02:18,482 --> 01:02:22,278
No, not until
after you've had your dinner.

897
01:02:22,313 --> 01:02:25,865
Come on! Grow up.

898
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:27,581
Don't leave me, Clem.
Oh, my God.

899
01:02:27,616 --> 01:02:30,119
No, I'm right here.
This is sort of warped.

900
01:02:30,154 --> 01:02:33,056
I'm scared.
I want my mommy.

901
01:02:33,091 --> 01:02:35,958
Don't cry, baby Joel.
It's okay.

902
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:42,173
Joel, stop it!
I think it's working.
We're hidden, Joel. Look!

903
01:02:42,631 --> 01:02:43,924
Honey, look.

904
01:02:44,967 --> 01:02:46,177
Wait there.

905
01:02:50,181 --> 01:02:53,559
My crotch is still here,
just as you remembered it.

906
01:02:53,726 --> 01:02:54,810
Yuck.

907
01:02:59,273 --> 01:03:01,525
It stopped.
What?

908
01:03:02,651 --> 01:03:04,361
It stopped erasing.

909
01:03:04,779 --> 01:03:08,449
Oh, shit!
This is terrible.

910
01:03:11,118 --> 01:03:13,335
He's off the map.

911
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:16,791
Where?
I don't know where.

912
01:03:17,124 --> 01:03:20,920
This is very bad news.
Where are my glasses?

913
01:03:22,838 --> 01:03:26,932
Crap! What did we do?
What do I do?

914
01:03:26,967 --> 01:03:29,470
What shall we do?
I don't know what to do.

915
01:03:29,512 --> 01:03:32,807
What shall we do?
I just said, I don't know.

916
01:03:32,848 --> 01:03:34,475
I'm sorry.
What shall we do?

917
01:03:34,517 --> 01:03:37,777
I don't know. Mellow out.
You're freaking me out.

918
01:03:37,812 --> 01:03:42,003
We have to do something.
He could wake up
all half-baked.

919
01:03:42,038 --> 01:03:46,195
Quiet.
You're freaking me out.
All gooey and half-baked.

920
01:03:47,154 --> 01:03:49,886
That sounds so good.
I'm hungry.

921
01:03:49,921 --> 01:03:52,618
Oh, shit. What?

922
01:03:54,161 --> 01:03:55,795
We should call Howard.

923
01:03:55,830 --> 01:03:59,708
No way. No sir, man.
This is my...
I can handle this.

924
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:01,585
You can't call Howard.

925
01:04:03,129 --> 01:04:05,012
There's no time
to fuck around.

926
01:04:05,047 --> 01:04:07,383
I've got this under control.
What are you talking about?

927
01:04:07,418 --> 01:04:08,589
Stop fucking around.

928
01:04:08,624 --> 01:04:09,760
Okay. I'll call Howard.

929
01:04:17,893 --> 01:04:18,984
Hello?

930
01:04:19,019 --> 01:04:23,441
Howard, it's Stan.
I'm working on this guy
down here.

931
01:04:23,476 --> 01:04:25,067
We've lost him
for a moment,

932
01:04:25,901 --> 01:04:28,362
and I can't
bring him back up.

933
01:04:28,404 --> 01:04:31,997
Okay, tell me what happened
before he disappeared.

934
01:04:32,032 --> 01:04:35,369
I wasn't sure
because I was away
from the monitor for a minute,

935
01:04:35,411 --> 01:04:39,290
and I had it on auto-pilot
because I had to pee.

936
01:04:39,325 --> 01:04:41,041
Where was Patrick?

937
01:04:41,083 --> 01:04:43,627
He had to go home sick.

938
01:04:46,589 --> 01:04:47,715
What's the address?

939
01:04:47,756 --> 01:04:48,945
I know,
I'm so sorry.

940
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:50,099
That's okay. Come on.

941
01:04:50,134 --> 01:04:52,303
We're at 159 South Village.

942
01:04:52,636 --> 01:04:55,389
Apartment 1-E.
Rockville Center.

943
01:04:55,556 --> 01:04:57,725
Mary, he's coming right now.

944
01:04:57,933 --> 01:04:58,934
I'm staying.

945
01:05:00,102 --> 01:05:02,062
Get your stuff, Mary.

946
01:05:02,605 --> 01:05:03,898
I think you should go.

947
01:05:04,273 --> 01:05:05,316
No.

948
01:05:08,944 --> 01:05:10,571
I am so stoned.

949
01:05:10,613 --> 01:05:13,748
Please, Mary,
you have to go.

950
01:05:13,783 --> 01:05:17,161
Stop being stoned.
I don't want him
to see me stoned.

951
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:22,208
You have no idea
how much trouble I'll get into
if Howard comes...

952
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:25,377
Joel, stop. Look.

953
01:05:31,801 --> 01:05:35,888
I want her to pick me up.
Weird how strong
that desire is.

954
01:05:35,923 --> 01:05:39,100
Joel, look at me.
You'll remember me
in the morning,

955
01:05:39,141 --> 01:05:42,978
you'll come to me,
you'll tell me about us,
and we'll start over.

956
01:05:44,438 --> 01:05:47,608
Pat? I thought we could
have a little cocktail.

957
01:05:47,643 --> 01:05:50,402
That Patrick guy,
he's copying me.

958
01:05:50,437 --> 01:05:51,862
What Patrick guy?

959
01:05:52,029 --> 01:05:53,781
That guy.
What?

960
01:05:53,823 --> 01:05:55,915
He's here, in my apartment.

961
01:05:55,950 --> 01:05:59,578
One of the eraser guys.
He fell for you
when they were doing you,

962
01:05:59,613 --> 01:06:03,207
and now
he's introduced himself
like he doesn't even know you,

963
01:06:03,582 --> 01:06:05,793
and you guys are dating.
Really?

964
01:06:06,794 --> 01:06:07,920
Is he cute?

965
01:06:10,422 --> 01:06:12,598
There's nothing wrong
with you.

966
01:06:12,633 --> 01:06:15,678
You're the most wonderful
person I've ever met.

967
01:06:16,887 --> 01:06:19,849
You're kind, beautiful,

968
01:06:20,975 --> 01:06:25,271
smart, funny, and nice.

969
01:06:26,397 --> 01:06:27,440
What?

970
01:06:29,108 --> 01:06:30,693
Okay, all right.

971
01:06:35,406 --> 01:06:37,950
Move. Come on,
let's go.
Careful.

972
01:06:39,994 --> 01:06:41,662
I'm still stoned.

973
01:06:42,955 --> 01:06:45,833
Those eye drops
you gave me didn't do shit.

974
01:06:50,504 --> 01:06:51,797
Be cool.

975
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:58,436
Hello, Mary,
what are you doing here?

976
01:06:58,471 --> 01:07:00,229
Hi, Howard.
She was just here
to help out.

977
01:07:00,264 --> 01:07:03,517
I wanted to understand
as much about the procedure
as possible.

978
01:07:03,726 --> 01:07:08,022
I think it's important
for my job to understand
the inner workings

979
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:09,697
of the work that we do.

980
01:07:09,732 --> 01:07:13,110
Not that I do,
but the work that is done

981
01:07:13,145 --> 01:07:15,029
by people where I also work.

982
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:16,614
The work of my colleagues.

983
01:07:17,823 --> 01:07:21,619
Let's see if we can
get to the bottom of this,
shall we?

984
01:07:27,291 --> 01:07:28,340
That's odd.

985
01:07:28,375 --> 01:07:29,925
I already tried that.

986
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:31,212
You tried going through
the C-gate?

987
01:07:31,253 --> 01:07:33,047
Of course.

988
01:07:33,339 --> 01:07:35,341
I mean, yes.

989
01:07:40,054 --> 01:07:41,388
All right.

990
01:07:43,724 --> 01:07:46,102
You want to get linked up?
Yeah.

991
01:07:48,229 --> 01:07:51,961
I ran the utility programs,
and I had nothing there,

992
01:07:51,996 --> 01:07:55,694
so I checked all the memories
against the printed logs.

993
01:07:55,729 --> 01:07:58,948
Here, Howard,
I got you a chair.
Thank you.

994
01:07:58,983 --> 01:08:01,075
There you go.
You're welcome.

995
01:08:02,118 --> 01:08:03,667
All right.
I've got it.

996
01:08:03,702 --> 01:08:06,455
I'll go through
the entire memory,

997
01:08:06,747 --> 01:08:07,748
see if something
comes up.

998
01:08:15,256 --> 01:08:17,216
I love being bathed
in the sink.

999
01:08:17,550 --> 01:08:19,343
Such a feeling of security.

1000
01:08:20,386 --> 01:08:22,763
I've never seen you happier,
baby Joel.

1001
01:08:23,722 --> 01:08:25,099
There it is.

1002
01:08:25,433 --> 01:08:28,727
I don't understand
why it's off the map
like that.

1003
01:08:30,396 --> 01:08:32,273
What the heck
was he doing there?

1004
01:08:41,532 --> 01:08:42,908
His eyes are open.

1005
01:08:45,494 --> 01:08:48,205
Has this happened before
with him?
No.

1006
01:08:49,248 --> 01:08:51,667
This is not good.

1007
01:08:55,045 --> 01:08:57,548
I'm going to have
to give him this.

1008
01:09:21,363 --> 01:09:24,241
Can't you see
I love you, Antoine?

1009
01:09:25,117 --> 01:09:26,869
Okay, we're back in.

1010
01:09:29,163 --> 01:09:34,001
That was beautiful to watch,
Howard, like a surgeon
or a concert pianist.

1011
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:38,005
Thank you, Mary.

1012
01:09:38,798 --> 01:09:42,134
Howard, you should
get some sleep.
I think I'll be fine now.

1013
01:09:42,169 --> 01:09:45,763
Can't you see I love you,
Antoine?

1014
01:09:47,306 --> 01:09:50,017
Lucky me. Lay one on me.

1015
01:09:54,688 --> 01:09:57,948
Don't call me Antoine.
My name is Wally.

1016
01:09:57,983 --> 01:10:01,529
Yes, I know, but how can
a woman love a man
with a name like Wally?

1017
01:10:02,655 --> 01:10:04,115
What was that?

1018
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:06,867
My God, there's people
coming out of your butt.

1019
01:10:06,902 --> 01:10:08,160
There is?

1020
01:10:10,538 --> 01:10:11,664
Got it.

1021
01:10:11,997 --> 01:10:15,960
Tangerine! Come on.
We've got to go.

1022
01:10:15,995 --> 01:10:18,170
Go on. Please go.

1023
01:10:21,298 --> 01:10:23,384
You can run,
but you can't hide.

1024
01:10:23,968 --> 01:10:25,344
Clem, come on!

1025
01:10:26,345 --> 01:10:27,346
There I am.

1026
01:10:29,306 --> 01:10:31,287
That truck.

1027
01:10:31,322 --> 01:10:33,269
Doc? Please!

1028
01:10:34,895 --> 01:10:39,650
Let's begin by
you telling me everything
you remember...

1029
01:10:40,568 --> 01:10:43,863
That's strange.
He's in a memory
that we've already erased.

1030
01:10:45,531 --> 01:10:48,868
At least we know where he is.
He's back on track, right?

1031
01:10:49,201 --> 01:10:50,418
Come on, Clem.

1032
01:10:50,453 --> 01:10:53,247
He's developed
some sort of resistance
to the procedure.

1033
01:10:53,282 --> 01:10:55,082
I don't want to run anymore.

1034
01:10:55,624 --> 01:10:56,625
Shit.

1035
01:10:58,210 --> 01:10:59,468
Come on.

1036
01:10:59,503 --> 01:11:01,922
Hide me somewhere deeper,
somewhere really buried.

1037
01:11:01,957 --> 01:11:04,592
Where?
Hide me in your humiliation.

1038
01:11:05,718 --> 01:11:06,809
Humiliation.

1039
01:11:06,844 --> 01:11:08,721
Come on, you big baby.

1040
01:11:17,271 --> 01:11:18,314
No!

1041
01:11:19,648 --> 01:11:21,859
Bye, Howard.
Wait.

1042
01:11:23,194 --> 01:11:24,779
He's disappeared again.

1043
01:11:24,987 --> 01:11:26,405
Oh, dear.

1044
01:11:28,073 --> 01:11:29,575
I'm so sorry, Howard.

1045
01:11:30,117 --> 01:11:31,535
Humiliation.

1046
01:11:37,875 --> 01:11:41,921
I don't like it, either.
I'm trying to find
horrible secret places to...

1047
01:11:41,956 --> 01:11:43,923
Honey, I have a surprise.

1048
01:11:45,466 --> 01:11:47,885
You know what?
I'll just ask you
in the morning.

1049
01:11:48,969 --> 01:11:49,929
Good night.

1050
01:11:54,016 --> 01:11:56,185
I'm sorry.
Shut up.

1051
01:11:57,728 --> 01:11:58,938
Look.

1052
01:12:01,148 --> 01:12:04,151
Joel, look where we are.

1053
01:12:08,364 --> 01:12:09,663
This isn't good.

1054
01:12:09,698 --> 01:12:13,327
Then hide me somewhere
really buried.

1055
01:12:14,453 --> 01:12:16,545
Hit it, Joel!

1056
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:20,835
I can't,
I've got to go home.
I'll do it later!

1057
01:12:40,563 --> 01:12:42,363
He has a girlfriend.

1058
01:12:42,398 --> 01:12:46,360
Wait, what am I doing?
Freddy, you don't
scare me anymore.

1059
01:12:49,488 --> 01:12:51,866
Joely, get up.
Come on, it's not worth it.

1060
01:12:51,901 --> 01:12:53,993
They're not worth it, Joel.

1061
01:12:55,369 --> 01:12:57,121
He's not listening!
Come on.

1062
01:12:57,156 --> 01:12:58,539
Stupid!

1063
01:13:05,087 --> 01:13:06,887
I'm so ashamed.

1064
01:13:06,922 --> 01:13:11,510
It's okay.
You were a little kid.
Come on.

1065
01:13:11,719 --> 01:13:13,596
That's where I live, lived.

1066
01:13:13,846 --> 01:13:15,771
I wish I knew you
when I was a kid.

1067
01:13:15,806 --> 01:13:18,267
Do you like my pink hat?
Here, look, feel better.

1068
01:13:18,302 --> 01:13:20,728
You can really kill me
this time. It's my turn. Go.

1069
01:13:20,763 --> 01:13:23,355
You're really going to die,
though, okay?

1070
01:13:23,390 --> 01:13:24,707
One, two, three.

1071
01:13:24,742 --> 01:13:26,025
You're dead.

1072
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:28,986
My mom.

1073
01:13:29,236 --> 01:13:32,406
It's okay, we're playing.
It's not real.

1074
01:13:32,441 --> 01:13:33,664
He's killing me.

1075
01:13:33,699 --> 01:13:36,702
Are you dead yet?
You're dead!

1076
01:13:38,204 --> 01:13:41,123
I think
I got the hang of this.
I still don't understand it,

1077
01:13:41,158 --> 01:13:43,125
but I'm finding him
quickly enough.

1078
01:14:20,955 --> 01:14:22,414
Are you okay?

1079
01:14:26,502 --> 01:14:30,673
Oh, my God, that was terrible.
Almost three seconds.

1080
01:14:31,132 --> 01:14:32,431
Let's do it one more time.

1081
01:14:32,466 --> 01:14:34,009
One more
and then I get to go.

1082
01:14:48,607 --> 01:14:49,900
This is so cool!

1083
01:14:49,935 --> 01:14:51,735
Look out!

1084
01:14:55,823 --> 01:14:57,158
It's fluff.

1085
01:14:58,534 --> 01:14:59,952
Our house.

1086
01:15:05,207 --> 01:15:07,168
Wait, we've got to go.

1087
01:15:09,378 --> 01:15:10,921
Come on.

1088
01:15:18,846 --> 01:15:21,223
This is a really bad time
for this.

1089
01:15:23,392 --> 01:15:25,317
I don't even know
where we're going.

1090
01:15:25,352 --> 01:15:27,855
It's going to be fun.
It's the best place.

1091
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:30,691
No, this way.
This way. Come on.

1092
01:15:31,525 --> 01:15:33,402
You're no help at all.

1093
01:15:35,362 --> 01:15:36,572
Come on.

1094
01:15:37,198 --> 01:15:39,033
Let go of me, Joel.

1095
01:15:52,421 --> 01:15:54,507
I like watching you work,
Howard.

1096
01:15:58,969 --> 01:16:03,224
I guess I'll go out
for some air,

1097
01:16:03,682 --> 01:16:05,101
if nobody minds.

1098
01:16:05,476 --> 01:16:08,854
It looks like
you have everything
under control here.

1099
01:16:09,146 --> 01:16:11,899
Yeah, that's fine.

1100
01:16:23,202 --> 01:16:25,329
Do you like quotes, Howard?

1101
01:16:26,914 --> 01:16:28,665
What do you mean?

1102
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:30,417
Like famous quotes.

1103
01:16:31,377 --> 01:16:33,719
I find reading them
inspirational,

1104
01:16:33,754 --> 01:16:38,592
and in my reading,
I've come across some
I thought you might like, too.

1105
01:16:39,677 --> 01:16:41,310
I'd love to hear some.

1106
01:16:41,345 --> 01:16:44,390
There's one that goes,
"Blessed are the forgetful,

1107
01:16:44,425 --> 01:16:47,435
"for they get the better
even of their blunders."

1108
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:49,276
That's Nietzsche, right?
Yeah.

1109
01:16:49,311 --> 01:16:52,481
I thought I could tell you
something you didn't know.

1110
01:16:52,516 --> 01:16:55,651
No, it's a good quote.
I'm happy we both know it.

1111
01:16:57,445 --> 01:16:59,078
There's this
other one I like.

1112
01:16:59,113 --> 01:17:00,823
It's by Pope Alexander
and it goes...

1113
01:17:01,574 --> 01:17:03,346
Alexander Pope?

1114
01:17:03,381 --> 01:17:05,119
Oh, yeah. Shit.

1115
01:17:05,786 --> 01:17:08,914
It's just that I told myself
not to say "Pope Alexander"

1116
01:17:08,949 --> 01:17:12,042
and sound like a dope,
and then I go ahead
and say it.

1117
01:17:12,077 --> 01:17:14,962
It's no big deal.
You're such a sweetheart.

1118
01:17:17,465 --> 01:17:21,093
The quote goes, "How happy
is the blameless vestal's lot!

1119
01:17:22,595 --> 01:17:25,389
"The world forgetting
by the world forgot

1120
01:17:26,474 --> 01:17:28,934
"Eternal sunshine
of the spotless mind!

1121
01:17:29,977 --> 01:17:34,127
"Each pray'r accepted
and each wish resign'd"

1122
01:17:34,162 --> 01:17:38,277
I want to be a great,
big, huge elephant.

1123
01:17:39,278 --> 01:17:41,489
With a huge trunk like that.

1124
01:17:45,868 --> 01:17:48,454
I haven't heard that one.
It's lovely.

1125
01:17:48,829 --> 01:17:51,499
I just thought
it would be appropriate,
maybe.

1126
01:17:56,504 --> 01:17:58,839
I really admire
the work you do.

1127
01:18:00,299 --> 01:18:02,468
I don't mean to be
so familiar...

1128
01:18:02,503 --> 01:18:04,637
It's fine.
I'm happy to hear...

1129
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:12,436
I'm sorry.

1130
01:18:16,398 --> 01:18:18,943
I've loved you
for a very long time.

1131
01:18:21,737 --> 01:18:24,114
I shouldn't have said that.

1132
01:18:24,149 --> 01:18:26,492
Mary, you're
a wonderful girl.

1133
01:18:29,036 --> 01:18:31,705
But, you know,
I have a wife and kids.

1134
01:18:37,461 --> 01:18:40,005
Mary, we can't do this.

1135
01:18:56,605 --> 01:18:58,816
Good morning,
Mrs. Mierzwiak.

1136
01:19:08,409 --> 01:19:10,494
What? Who is it?
Oh, my God.

1137
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:26,385
Thank you, Stan.
Thanks a lot.

1138
01:19:31,807 --> 01:19:33,851
Hollis!

1139
01:19:37,313 --> 01:19:38,397
Wait.

1140
01:19:40,357 --> 01:19:41,866
I knew it, Howard.

1141
01:19:41,901 --> 01:19:44,361
It didn't start out like this.
I came here to work.

1142
01:19:44,396 --> 01:19:46,620
This is a one-time mistake.

1143
01:19:46,655 --> 01:19:48,886
I'm a stupid girl
with a crush.

1144
01:19:48,921 --> 01:19:51,118
I basically
forced him into it.

1145
01:19:52,536 --> 01:19:54,955
Don't be a monster.
Tell the girl.

1146
01:19:58,125 --> 01:19:59,585
Tell me what?

1147
01:20:00,169 --> 01:20:01,796
Oh, you poor kid.

1148
01:20:03,672 --> 01:20:06,759
You can have him.
You did.

1149
01:20:17,770 --> 01:20:18,854
What?

1150
01:20:29,156 --> 01:20:30,825
We have a history.

1151
01:20:32,868 --> 01:20:35,955
I'm sorry.
You wanted the procedure.

1152
01:20:37,957 --> 01:20:42,545
You wanted it done
so you could get past...

1153
01:20:50,219 --> 01:20:54,682
I have to
finish the work in there.
It's almost morning.

1154
01:20:56,851 --> 01:21:00,312
We'll talk later, okay?

1155
01:21:18,873 --> 01:21:21,000
Let me give you a lift home.

1156
01:21:36,557 --> 01:21:40,019
Didn't figure you'd show
your face around me again.

1157
01:21:40,936 --> 01:21:43,898
I thought you were humiliated.

1158
01:21:44,106 --> 01:21:45,858
You did run away,
after all.

1159
01:21:46,525 --> 01:21:48,444
I just needed to see you.

1160
01:21:48,479 --> 01:21:49,528
Yeah?

1161
01:21:51,155 --> 01:21:52,823
I'd like to

1162
01:21:53,908 --> 01:21:55,701
take you out or something.

1163
01:21:57,077 --> 01:21:58,621
You're married.

1164
01:21:59,371 --> 01:22:01,582
Not yet. Not married.

1165
01:22:02,541 --> 01:22:04,251
No, I'm not married.

1166
01:22:04,418 --> 01:22:08,047
Look, I'm telling you
right off the bat,
I'm high maintenance,

1167
01:22:08,082 --> 01:22:11,109
so I'm not gonna tiptoe
around your marriage

1168
01:22:11,144 --> 01:22:14,037
or whatever it is
you've got going there.

1169
01:22:14,072 --> 01:22:16,931
If you want to be with me,
you're with me.

1170
01:22:17,431 --> 01:22:18,557
Okay.

1171
01:22:19,266 --> 01:22:22,770
Too many guys think
I'm a concept,
or I complete them

1172
01:22:22,805 --> 01:22:25,106
or I'm gonna make them alive.

1173
01:22:25,689 --> 01:22:29,318
I'm just a fucked-up girl
who's looking for
my own peace of mind.

1174
01:22:29,353 --> 01:22:30,743
Don't assign me yours.

1175
01:22:30,778 --> 01:22:33,072
I remember that speech
really well.

1176
01:22:34,115 --> 01:22:35,706
I had you pegged,
didn't I?

1177
01:22:35,741 --> 01:22:37,701
Had the whole human race
pegged.

1178
01:22:38,452 --> 01:22:39,703
Probably.

1179
01:22:41,705 --> 01:22:43,833
I still thought
you were going
to save my life.

1180
01:22:44,166 --> 01:22:45,167
Even after that.

1181
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:48,629
I know.

1182
01:22:51,590 --> 01:22:53,551
It would be different,

1183
01:22:54,969 --> 01:22:57,596
if we could just
give it another go-round.

1184
01:23:01,267 --> 01:23:04,770
Remember me.
Try your best.

1185
01:23:08,315 --> 01:23:09,817
Maybe we can.

1186
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:43,871
Just tell me
what you remember,

1187
01:23:43,906 --> 01:23:46,103
and we'll take it
from there.

1188
01:23:49,356 --> 01:23:51,442
I liked you immediately.

1189
01:23:52,318 --> 01:23:55,821
You didn't come on to me
at all. I liked that.

1190
01:23:58,324 --> 01:24:00,910
I was so tongue-tied
around you at first,

1191
01:24:00,945 --> 01:24:03,496
but I wanted you to think
I was smart.

1192
01:24:04,997 --> 01:24:07,173
I couldn't wait
to come to work.

1193
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:11,712
I had these fantasies
of us being married
and having kids...

1194
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:16,217
Howie, I can't do this.

1195
01:24:17,093 --> 01:24:19,220
We agreed
it's for the best, Mary.

1196
01:24:19,255 --> 01:24:20,513
Yeah, I know.

1197
01:24:22,473 --> 01:24:23,766
O£, God!

1198
01:24:24,225 --> 01:24:26,435
I'll take the bottom
and you...

1199
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:28,646
No, Joel,
help me with that.

1200
01:24:28,681 --> 01:24:29,820
Will you get the cooler?

1201
01:24:29,855 --> 01:24:31,607
Honey, the cooler's pretty...

1202
01:24:31,642 --> 01:24:32,900
She can get it.

1203
01:24:33,734 --> 01:24:35,653
Let me get that.
No, no, no.

1204
01:24:35,688 --> 01:24:36,838
Don't take anything.

1205
01:24:36,873 --> 01:24:38,598
I can take the plane.

1206
01:24:38,633 --> 01:24:40,324
Put the gate back up.

1207
01:24:43,577 --> 01:24:45,496
This is the day we met.

1208
01:24:45,746 --> 01:24:49,250
You were by the surf.
I could just make you out
in the distance.

1209
01:24:49,285 --> 01:24:51,961
I remember being drawn to you,
even then.

1210
01:24:51,996 --> 01:24:54,105
I thought,
"Wow, how odd!

1211
01:24:54,140 --> 01:24:56,215
"I'm drawn to someone's back."

1212
01:24:56,424 --> 01:24:58,599
You were
in that orange sweatshirt

1213
01:24:58,634 --> 01:25:02,221
that I would
come to know so well,
and even hate, eventually.

1214
01:25:02,763 --> 01:25:06,976
But at the time I thought,
"How cool,
an orange sweatshirt."

1215
01:25:07,011 --> 01:25:08,310
Hi, there.

1216
01:25:10,563 --> 01:25:11,737
Hi.

1217
01:25:11,772 --> 01:25:15,484
I saw you sitting over here
by yourself,

1218
01:25:16,777 --> 01:25:19,447
and I thought,
"Thank God,

1219
01:25:19,613 --> 01:25:23,242
"someone normal who
doesn't know how to interact
at these things."

1220
01:25:24,785 --> 01:25:27,413
I don't ever know
what to say.

1221
01:25:28,038 --> 01:25:29,582
I'm Clementine.

1222
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:33,627
Can I borrow
a piece of your chicken?

1223
01:25:34,503 --> 01:25:37,715
And then you just took it,
without waiting for an answer.

1224
01:25:42,344 --> 01:25:46,098
It was so intimate,
like we were already lovers.

1225
01:25:48,726 --> 01:25:49,977
I'm Joel.

1226
01:25:51,061 --> 01:25:54,815
Hi, Joel.
So, no jokes about my name.

1227
01:25:56,525 --> 01:25:57,575
You mean, like

1228
01:25:57,610 --> 01:26:00,279
"Oh, my darlin', Clementine?"

1229
01:26:00,863 --> 01:26:03,407
Huckleberry Hound?
That sort of thing?

1230
01:26:03,442 --> 01:26:05,343
Yeah, like that.

1231
01:26:05,378 --> 01:26:07,244
No, no jokes.

1232
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:09,789
One of my favorite things
when I was a kid

1233
01:26:09,824 --> 01:26:11,999
was my Huckleberry Hound doll.

1234
01:26:15,503 --> 01:26:17,671
I think your name is magical.

1235
01:26:20,674 --> 01:26:24,178
This is it, Joel.
It's gonna be gone soon.

1236
01:26:27,139 --> 01:26:28,307
I know.

1237
01:26:29,725 --> 01:26:31,185
What do we do?

1238
01:26:34,188 --> 01:26:35,439
Enjoy it.

1239
01:26:53,082 --> 01:26:54,917
You married?
No.

1240
01:26:55,167 --> 01:26:57,468
Let's move into
this neighborhood!

1241
01:26:57,503 --> 01:27:00,005
I do sort of live
with someone, though.

1242
01:27:00,548 --> 01:27:02,550
Male or female?

1243
01:27:02,585 --> 01:27:04,552
What? Female.

1244
01:27:08,347 --> 01:27:11,183
At least I'm not barking up
the wrong tree.

1245
01:27:14,395 --> 01:27:16,167
Do you know these people?

1246
01:27:16,202 --> 01:27:17,940
No, of course not.
Come on.

1247
01:27:20,359 --> 01:27:21,902
They might have a dog.

1248
01:27:21,937 --> 01:27:23,237
There's no dog.

1249
01:27:25,239 --> 01:27:26,990
What are you doing?

1250
01:27:27,025 --> 01:27:28,742
It's freezing out.

1251
01:27:29,743 --> 01:27:31,537
I don't believe this.

1252
01:27:43,758 --> 01:27:46,135
Come on, man.
The water's fine.

1253
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:50,306
Nobody's coming here tonight,
believe me.

1254
01:27:54,810 --> 01:27:58,481
So, what's
your girlfriend's name?

1255
01:27:59,648 --> 01:28:02,026
Naomi,
but we're not really...

1256
01:28:03,277 --> 01:28:06,162
Whatever.
So this is great.

1257
01:28:06,197 --> 01:28:11,076
Now I can look
for candles, matches,
and the liquor cabinet.

1258
01:28:11,285 --> 01:28:12,495
Oh, God.

1259
01:28:19,502 --> 01:28:20,982
I think we should go.

1260
01:28:21,017 --> 01:28:22,463
There's no phone line.

1261
01:28:22,922 --> 01:28:24,764
What?
I think we should go.

1262
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:28,594
Why? It's our house.
Just for tonight.

1263
01:28:28,629 --> 01:28:31,722
We are
David and Ruth Laskin.

1264
01:28:33,140 --> 01:28:34,934
Which one do you want to be?

1265
01:28:35,142 --> 01:28:38,229
I prefer to be Ruth,
but I can be flexible.

1266
01:28:40,564 --> 01:28:41,982
What do you need?

1267
01:28:43,818 --> 01:28:44,944
Alcohol.

1268
01:28:46,987 --> 01:28:48,572
So, are you okay with wine?

1269
01:28:48,607 --> 01:28:49,747
I don't know.

1270
01:28:49,782 --> 01:28:51,457
Well, you choose the wine.

1271
01:28:51,492 --> 01:28:55,454
I'll go find the bedroom
and slip into
something more Ruth.

1272
01:28:58,958 --> 01:29:01,877
I'm Ruth-less at the moment.
We really should go.

1273
01:29:04,171 --> 01:29:06,215
I've got to catch my ride.

1274
01:29:08,384 --> 01:29:09,844
So go.

1275
01:29:10,928 --> 01:29:14,849
I did. I thought
maybe you were a nut.

1276
01:29:16,225 --> 01:29:17,935
But you were exciting.

1277
01:29:20,187 --> 01:29:21,987
I wish you'd stayed.

1278
01:29:22,022 --> 01:29:25,025
I wish I'd stayed, too.
Now I wish I'd stayed.

1279
01:29:25,060 --> 01:29:27,361
I wish I'd done
a lot of things.

1280
01:29:34,452 --> 01:29:37,204
I wish I'd stayed. I do.

1281
01:29:37,371 --> 01:29:39,957
I came back downstairs
and you were gone.

1282
01:29:39,992 --> 01:29:42,758
I walked out the door.
Why?

1283
01:29:42,793 --> 01:29:45,880
I don't know. I felt
like a scared little kid.

1284
01:29:46,505 --> 01:29:48,257
It was above my head.

1285
01:29:49,049 --> 01:29:51,010
You were scared?
Yeah.

1286
01:29:53,387 --> 01:29:55,723
I thought
you knew that about me.

1287
01:29:56,348 --> 01:29:59,977
I ran back
to the bonfire, trying
to outrun my humiliation.

1288
01:30:01,061 --> 01:30:03,731
Was it something I said?
Yeah.

1289
01:30:06,609 --> 01:30:10,404
You said "So go"
with such disdain.

1290
01:30:11,739 --> 01:30:13,136
I'm sorry.

1291
01:30:13,171 --> 01:30:14,533
It's okay.

1292
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:24,960
What if you stayed this time?

1293
01:30:27,505 --> 01:30:28,923
I walked out the door.

1294
01:30:30,591 --> 01:30:31,550
There's no memory left.

1295
01:30:32,134 --> 01:30:34,220
Come back
and make up a goodbye.

1296
01:30:35,429 --> 01:30:36,806
Let's pretend
we had one.

1297
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:49,735
Bye, Joel.

1298
01:30:51,237 --> 01:30:52,613
I love you.

1299
01:30:53,197 --> 01:30:56,450
Meet me in Montauk.

1300
01:31:01,205 --> 01:31:04,125
I didn't crash the plane.
The plane crashed.

1301
01:31:05,668 --> 01:31:09,672
You were operating
the plane with the remote
control, and it crashed.

1302
01:31:09,707 --> 01:31:11,754
It was fucking windy.
Come on.

1303
01:31:11,789 --> 01:31:13,766
You're stoned
and you're driving.

1304
01:31:13,801 --> 01:31:17,304
The pot balances it out
and brings you back up.
That's why I smoke it.

1305
01:31:17,339 --> 01:31:20,106
If I'm going to be drinking,
then I'll smoke it.

1306
01:31:20,141 --> 01:31:25,104
It does. A medical test
was done. It's proven
on the Science Network.

1307
01:31:25,139 --> 01:31:26,856
Honey, just watch the road.

1308
01:31:26,891 --> 01:31:28,190
I can't see shit.

1309
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:33,070
I saw you talking
to a pretty girl.

1310
01:31:33,105 --> 01:31:34,203
She was nice.

1311
01:31:34,238 --> 01:31:36,115
Yeah, man, who was it?

1312
01:31:38,325 --> 01:31:41,412
She was just a girl.

1313
01:31:49,336 --> 01:31:50,421
Okay.

1314
01:32:27,541 --> 01:32:29,960
So I've got to
drop the van off.

1315
01:32:30,211 --> 01:32:33,172
Thanks, Stan. We'll talk.

1316
01:34:00,092 --> 01:34:01,427
You've got all your stuff,
I see.

1317
01:34:01,462 --> 01:34:02,518
That's right.

1318
01:34:02,553 --> 01:34:04,430
I take it
you're not coming back.

1319
01:34:04,847 --> 01:34:06,995
I wouldn't come back
if I was you.

1320
01:34:07,030 --> 01:34:09,143
Do you swear you didn't know?
I swear.

1321
01:34:10,519 --> 01:34:12,146
So you didn't do
the erasing?

1322
01:34:12,181 --> 01:34:13,863
Of course not. God, no.

1323
01:34:13,898 --> 01:34:16,525
And you never even suspected
we were together?

1324
01:34:17,193 --> 01:34:18,611
Once, maybe.

1325
01:34:20,654 --> 01:34:23,866
I was coming back from a job,
and you were at his car,

1326
01:34:24,074 --> 01:34:26,118
and I saw you two talking.

1327
01:34:26,660 --> 01:34:29,121
So I waved to you,
and you giggled.

1328
01:34:29,872 --> 01:34:31,415
How did I look?

1329
01:34:33,793 --> 01:34:35,336
You looked happy.

1330
01:34:35,836 --> 01:34:38,380
Happy with a secret.

1331
01:34:39,799 --> 01:34:41,307
And after that?

1332
01:34:41,342 --> 01:34:44,324
I never saw you two together
again like that,

1333
01:34:44,359 --> 01:34:47,306
so I just figured
I was imagining things.

1334
01:35:13,541 --> 01:35:17,837
I really like you, Mary Svevo.
You know that?

1335
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:30,599
Thanks.

1336
01:36:05,593 --> 01:36:07,553
Let me get my toothbrush.

1337
01:36:22,443 --> 01:36:25,411
Where are you, Clem?
I'm worried.

1338
01:36:25,446 --> 01:36:28,949
I feel like you're mad at me
and I don't know what I did.

1339
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:31,751
What did I do?

1340
01:36:31,786 --> 01:36:35,748
I love you so much.
I'll do anything
to make you happy.

1341
01:36:36,457 --> 01:36:39,752
Just tell me what you want
me to do, and I'll do it.

1342
01:36:40,002 --> 01:36:43,798
I'm going to stop by
this morning,
just to make sure you're okay.

1343
01:36:56,227 --> 01:36:57,853
Let's go, mister.

1344
01:36:59,355 --> 01:37:01,899
I had a really nice time
last night.

1345
01:37:03,067 --> 01:37:04,151
Nice?

1346
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:08,948
I had the best fucking night
of my entire fucking life
last night.

1347
01:37:09,323 --> 01:37:10,825
That's better.

1348
01:37:15,037 --> 01:37:16,379
This is weird.

1349
01:37:16,414 --> 01:37:18,958
"To all patients
of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak.

1350
01:37:18,993 --> 01:37:20,341
"My name is Mary Svevo.

1351
01:37:20,376 --> 01:37:22,510
"We've met,
but you don't remember me.

1352
01:37:22,545 --> 01:37:27,258
"I worked for a company
you hired to have
part of your memory erased.

1353
01:37:27,293 --> 01:37:30,142
"I've since decided
that this is a horrible...

1354
01:37:30,177 --> 01:37:33,931
"To correct this, I'm sending
everyone's file back to them."

1355
01:37:35,724 --> 01:37:38,102
My name
is Clementine Kruczynski.

1356
01:37:38,394 --> 01:37:41,021
I'm here to erase
Joel Barish.

1357
01:37:41,564 --> 01:37:43,858
What is this?
I don't know.

1358
01:37:43,893 --> 01:37:45,032
He's boring.

1359
01:37:45,067 --> 01:37:47,862
Is that enough reason
to erase someone?

1360
01:37:48,237 --> 01:37:52,700
I've been thinking how I was
before and how I am now,
and he changed me.

1361
01:37:52,735 --> 01:37:54,625
I feel like
I'm always pissy now.

1362
01:37:54,660 --> 01:37:57,913
I don't like myself
when I'm with him.
I don't like myself anymore.

1363
01:37:57,948 --> 01:37:59,839
I can't stand
to even look at him.

1364
01:37:59,874 --> 01:38:02,543
That pathetic, wimpy,
apologetic smile.

1365
01:38:02,578 --> 01:38:04,552
That sort of
wounded puppy shit.

1366
01:38:04,587 --> 01:38:06,679
What are you doing?
I'm not doing anything.

1367
01:38:06,714 --> 01:38:08,924
The bloom is certainly
off the rose at this point.

1368
01:38:08,959 --> 01:38:11,218
Are you screwing with me?
No!

1369
01:38:11,385 --> 01:38:14,054
You are screwing with me.
Joel, I'm not!

1370
01:38:14,089 --> 01:38:15,639
You clearly are!

1371
01:38:15,973 --> 01:38:18,517
Let's just take a minute
and...

1372
01:38:47,463 --> 01:38:50,633
Patrick,
get the fuck away from me!

1373
01:38:51,634 --> 01:38:54,386
Can we talk about it?
No, get the fuck away!

1374
01:39:29,130 --> 01:39:32,883
Hey, Clementine.
Nice to see you.

1375
01:39:40,015 --> 01:39:43,811
I mean,
she's smart, I think,
but not educated.

1376
01:39:44,353 --> 01:39:46,856
I couldn't talk to her
about books.

1377
01:39:46,981 --> 01:39:49,608
She's more of
a magazine-reading girl.

1378
01:39:50,317 --> 01:39:53,362
Her vocabulary leaves
something to be desired.

1379
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:56,414
The truth is,
I was embarrassed in public,

1380
01:39:56,449 --> 01:40:00,077
Hi.
Because she would pronounce
"library," "li-berry."

1381
01:40:05,374 --> 01:40:06,757
Look what I found.

1382
01:40:06,792 --> 01:40:10,671
I think if there's
a truly seductive quality
about Clementine,

1383
01:40:10,706 --> 01:40:14,550
it's that her personality
promises to take you
out of the mundane.

1384
01:40:16,343 --> 01:40:18,561
Made me look skinny.

1385
01:40:18,596 --> 01:40:22,433
An amazing, burning meteorite
will carry you
to another world

1386
01:40:22,468 --> 01:40:24,351
where things are exciting.

1387
01:40:26,729 --> 01:40:30,941
But what you quickly learn
is that it's really
an elaborate ruse.

1388
01:40:31,567 --> 01:40:33,611
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1389
01:40:34,904 --> 01:40:36,238
It's okay.

1390
01:40:41,202 --> 01:40:44,538
I really like you.
I hate that I said
mean things about you.

1391
01:40:44,573 --> 01:40:46,582
Let me turn this off, okay?

1392
01:40:47,416 --> 01:40:49,168
That's only fair.

1393
01:40:52,546 --> 01:40:55,883
The whole thing
with the hair,
it's all bullshit.

1394
01:40:55,918 --> 01:40:58,260
I really like your hair.

1395
01:40:58,295 --> 01:40:59,470
Thank you.

1396
01:40:59,929 --> 01:41:01,138
I do.

1397
01:41:04,517 --> 01:41:06,435
You want a drink or something?

1398
01:41:06,470 --> 01:41:08,062
Do you have any whiskey?

1399
01:41:09,688 --> 01:41:14,401
I didn't think
her sex was motivated.

1400
01:41:14,735 --> 01:41:18,739
I saw it clearly
the last night we were
together. It wasn't sexy.

1401
01:41:18,774 --> 01:41:21,200
It was just sad.

1402
01:41:22,410 --> 01:41:24,537
Sorry,
I thought there was more.

1403
01:41:24,662 --> 01:41:28,040
The only way Clem thinks
she can get people to like her

1404
01:41:28,075 --> 01:41:29,708
is to fuck them.

1405
01:41:30,918 --> 01:41:34,922
Or at least dangle
the possibility of getting
fucked in front of them.

1406
01:41:34,957 --> 01:41:38,384
I think she's
so desperate and insecure

1407
01:41:39,427 --> 01:41:42,721
that she'll sooner or later
go around fucking everybody.

1408
01:41:42,756 --> 01:41:43,896
I don't do that.

1409
01:41:43,931 --> 01:41:46,350
I wouldn't
think that about you.

1410
01:41:46,559 --> 01:41:48,561
Because I don't.
I know.

1411
01:41:48,811 --> 01:41:51,772
It hurts me
that you said that,
because I don't do that.

1412
01:41:51,807 --> 01:41:54,605
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry about all this.

1413
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:57,398
I'm going to go.
I'm a little confused.

1414
01:41:57,433 --> 01:42:00,156
I don't really think
I can be here.

1415
01:42:07,121 --> 01:42:08,080
Bye.

1416
01:42:08,789 --> 01:42:10,895
I really thought
I knew her so well.

1417
01:42:10,930 --> 01:42:13,002
It was nice meeting you
and all.

1418
01:42:15,838 --> 01:42:19,258
What a loss to spend
that much time with someone,

1419
01:42:19,293 --> 01:42:21,886
only to find out
that she's a stranger.

1420
01:42:26,807 --> 01:42:27,892
Wait.

1421
01:42:30,853 --> 01:42:33,112
What?
I don't know. Just wait.

1422
01:42:33,147 --> 01:42:37,902
What do you want, Joel?
I want you to wait
for a while.

1423
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:54,460
Okay.
Really?

1424
01:42:55,294 --> 01:42:59,298
I'm not a concept,
just a fucked-up girl
looking for my peace of mind.

1425
01:42:59,333 --> 01:43:00,848
I'm not perfect.

1426
01:43:00,883 --> 01:43:03,427
I can't see anything
that I don't like about you.

1427
01:43:03,462 --> 01:43:05,805
But you will.
Right now I can't.

1428
01:43:06,263 --> 01:43:07,980
You will think of things.

1429
01:43:08,015 --> 01:43:09,975
And I'll get bored with you
and feel trapped,

1430
01:43:10,010 --> 01:43:12,353
because that's what happens
with me.

1431
01:43:13,854 --> 01:43:14,939
Okay.

1432
01:43:19,443 --> 01:43:20,528
Okay.

1433
01:43:25,241 --> 01:43:26,367
Okay.
