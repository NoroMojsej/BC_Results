1
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,313
<i>I think it's our tradition.</i>

2
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:06,067
It comes out of a particularly
painful part of our history.

3
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,277
Yes, yes.

4
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,362
But it's been the way
we've been able to heal.

5
00:01:10,447 --> 00:01:12,614
At first, it was a
reminder of the rebellion.

6
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:15,534
- It was a price the districts had to pay.
- Yes.

7
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,870
But I think it has
grown from that.

8
00:01:17,954 --> 00:01:21,373
I think it's something that
knits us all together.

9
00:01:23,585 --> 00:01:25,462
This is your third
year as Gamemaker.

10
00:01:27,463 --> 00:01:30,591
What defines your
personal signature?

11
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,804
No! No!

12
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:41,227
It's okay. It's okay.
You were just dreaming.

13
00:01:43,313 --> 00:01:44,646
It was me.

14
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,859
I know. I know. But it's not.

15
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:52,155
It's your first year, Prim.
Your name's only been in there once.

16
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,323
They're not gonna pick you.

17
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,575
Try to go to sleep.

18
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:57,868
I can't.

19
00:01:58,495 --> 00:02:01,371
Just try. Just try.

20
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:07,045
Mmm-hmm.

21
00:02:12,258 --> 00:02:16,179
<i>Deep in the meadow.</i>

22
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:20,599
<i>Under the willow</i>

23
00:02:21,893 --> 00:02:25,771
<i>A bed of grass.</i>

24
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:29,859
<i>A soft green pillow.</i>

25
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:33,780
You remember that song? Okay.

26
00:02:34,364 --> 00:02:36,156
You finish it. I've got to go.

27
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,283
Where?

28
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,326
I've just got to go.

29
00:02:39,828 --> 00:02:42,454
<i>But I'll be back. I love you</i>

30
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,841
I'll still cook you.

31
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:05,014
What are you gonna do
with that when you kill it?

32
00:05:07,684 --> 00:05:10,519
Damn you, Gale! It's not funny!

33
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:13,648
What are you gonna do with
a 100-pound deer, Catnip?

34
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,274
It's Reaping Day. The place is
crawling with Peacekeepers.

35
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,487
I was gonna sell it
to some Peacekeepers.

36
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,779
Of course you were.

37
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,115
Like you don't sell
to Peacekeepers.

38
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,533
No. Not today.

39
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,619
It was the first deerl've seen in a year.
Now I have nothing.

40
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:27,829
Okay.

41
00:06:18,588 --> 00:06:21,173
What if they did? Just one year.
What if everyone just stopped watching?

42
00:06:21,257 --> 00:06:23,384
- They won't, Gale.
- What if they did? What if we did?

43
00:06:23,468 --> 00:06:25,011
Won't happen.

44
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,180
You root for your favorites.
You cry when they get killed.

45
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,514
- It's sick.
- Gale.

46
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:30,975
If no one watches, then
they don't have a game.

47
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:32,518
It's as simple as that.

48
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,187
- What?
- Nothing.

49
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:38,316
- Fine. Laugh at me.
- I'm not laughing at you.

50
00:06:44,197 --> 00:06:46,199
We could do it, you know?

51
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,411
Take off, live in the woods.
It's what we do anyway.

52
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:51,536
They'd catch us.

53
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,247
Well, maybe not.

54
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:57,375
Cut out our tongues, or worse.
We wouldn't make it five Miles.

55
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:00,295
No, I'd get five Miles.
I'd go that way.

56
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:03,048
I have Prim, and
you have your brothers.

57
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:04,132
They can come, too.

58
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:05,718
Prim in the woods?

59
00:07:07,762 --> 00:07:09,262
Or maybe not.

60
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:12,475
I'm never having kids.

61
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:15,728
I might, if I didn't live here.

62
00:07:15,812 --> 00:07:17,980
- But you do live here.
- I know, but if I didn't.

63
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:22,901
Oh, I forgot.

64
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:24,569
Here.

65
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:27,240
Oh, my God! Is this real?

66
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,408
Yeah. Better be.
Cost me a squirrel.

67
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,745
Happy Hunger Games.

68
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:35,790
"And may the odds be
ever in your favor."

69
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,754
How many times is
your name in today?

70
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:44,173
Forty-two.

71
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:48,009
Guess the odds aren't
exactly in my favor.

72
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,747
- Thank you, girl.
- Mmm-hmm.

73
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,132
What's this?

74
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:28,718
That's a Mockingjay.

75
00:08:31,012 --> 00:08:32,263
How much?

76
00:08:34,307 --> 00:08:37,309
- You keep it. It's yours.
- Thank you.

77
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:51,115
Mom.

78
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:54,451
Aw, look at you!

79
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:56,995
You look beautiful.

80
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:59,706
But you better tuck in
that tail, little duck.

81
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,417
I laid something
out for you, too.

82
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:05,421
Okay.

83
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,905
Now you look beautiful, too.

84
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,698
Wish I looked like you.

85
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:37,953
Oh, no. I wish I looked
like you, little duck.

86
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:46,544
Hey. You want to see
what I got you today?

87
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,551
It's a Mockingjay pin.
To protect you.

88
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:58,014
And as long as you have it,
nothing bad will happen to you.

89
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,267
Okay? I promise.

90
00:10:56,407 --> 00:10:57,991
Shh. Shh.

91
00:10:58,075 --> 00:10:59,951
Prim, it's okay. It's okay. Shh.

92
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:01,787
Okay. It's time to sign in now.
Okay?

93
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,998
They're gonna prick your finger
just to take a little bit of blood.

94
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,206
- You didn't say...
- I know.

95
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,875
It doesn't hurt much.
Just a little.

96
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,879
Okay? Go sit down there with the little
kids. I'll find you after. Okay?

97
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,214
Next.

98
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:13,548
Next.

99
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,897
Go ahead. Next.

100
00:11:29,065 --> 00:11:30,066
Next.

101
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,161
Next.

102
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:46,164
Next.

103
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,277
It's okay.

104
00:12:21,826 --> 00:12:24,745
<i>Welcome! Welcome, welcome.</i>

105
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,498
<i>Happy Hunger Games.</i>

106
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:31,918
<i>And may the odds be
ever in your favor.</i>

107
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:37,799
<i>Now, before we begin, we
have a very special film.</i>

108
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:41,553
<i>Brought to you all the
way from The Capitol.</i>

109
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:47,393
War. Terrible war.

110
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:49,979
War.

111
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:55,734
<i>Terrible war. Widows,
orphans, a motherless child.</i>

112
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,446
<i>This was the uprising
that rocked our land.</i>

113
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,491
<i>Thirteen districts rebelled against
the country that fed them,</i>

114
00:13:03,576 --> 00:13:05,410
<i>loved them, protected them.</i>

115
00:13:06,162 --> 00:13:09,373
<i>Brother turned on brother
until nothing remained.</i>

116
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:14,336
<i>And then came the peace,
hard fought, sorely won.</i>

117
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:18,716
<i>A people rose up from the
ashes, and a new era was born.</i>

118
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:23,678
<i>But freedom has a cost.
And the traitors were defeated.</i>

119
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:28,350
<i>We swore as a nation we would
never know this treason again.</i>

120
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:33,647
<i>And so it was decreed that each
year the various districts of Panem</i>

121
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,359
<i>would offer up, in tribute,
one young man and woman</i>

122
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:42,615
<i>to fight to the death in a pageant
of honor, courage, and sacrifice.</i>

123
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:46,994
<i>The lone Victor, bathed in riches,
would serve as a reminder</i>

124
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:50,121
<i>of our generosity and
our forgiveness.</i>

125
00:13:50,206 --> 00:13:52,875
<i>This is how we
remember our past.</i>

126
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:57,004
<i>This is how we safeguard our future.</i>

127
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,672
<i>I just love that!</i>

128
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:05,136
<i>Now, the time has
come for us to select</i>

129
00:14:05,221 --> 00:14:09,099
<i>one courageous young
man and woman</i>

130
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:17,066
<i>for the honor of representing District
12 in the 74th Annual Hunger Games.</i>

131
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,903
<i>As usual, ladies first.</i>

132
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:49,597
<i>Primrose Everdeen.</i>

133
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,606
<i>Where are you, dear?</i>

134
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,525
<i>Come on up.</i>

135
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:03,320
<i>Well, come on up.</i>

136
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:27,469
Prim! Prim!

137
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,471
No. No!

138
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:31,724
I volunteer! I volunteer!

139
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:34,475
I volunteer as Tribute!

140
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,732
<i>I believe we have a volunteer, Mr.
Mayor.</i>

141
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:42,775
Prim, you need to get out of here.
You need to get out of here.

142
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,193
- No! No!
- Go find Mom!

143
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:45,903
- Prim, go find Mom right now. I'm so sorry.
- No!

144
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:49,450
- Go find Mom. Prim, leave! Go find Mom.
- No! No! No!

145
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:53,120
- No! No! No!
- Come on.

146
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:56,414
<i>A dramatic turn of events
here in District 12.</i>

147
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,293
<i>Yes, well.</i>

148
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:03,254
<i>District 12's very first volunteer.
Bring her up.</i>

149
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:08,844
Come on, dear.

150
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,105
<i>What's your name?</i>

151
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:21,856
<i>Katniss Everdeen.</i>

152
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,860
<i>Well, I bet my hat that
was your sister, wasn't it?</i>

153
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,364
<i>Yes.</i>

154
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:34,827
<i>Let's have a big hand for our very
first volunteer, Katniss Everdeen.</i>

155
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,885
<i>And now for the boys.</i>

156
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,230
<i>Peeta Mellark.</i>

157
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:27,506
<i>Here we are.</i>

158
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,426
<i>Our Tributes from District 12.</i>

159
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,387
<i>Well, go on, you
two, shake hands.</i>

160
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,569
<i>Happy Hunger Games.</i>

161
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:53,865
<i>And may the odds be
ever in your favor.</i>

162
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,881
You have three minutes.

163
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:13,801
It's okay.

164
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:18,265
Prim. Prim. It's okay. Prim,
I don't have much time.

165
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:22,894
Prim. Listen. You're gonna be okay.
Don't take any extra food from them.

166
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:25,189
It isn't worth putting your
name in more times. Okay?

167
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:29,233
Listen, Prim. Gale will bring you game.
You can sell cheese from your goat.

168
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:31,903
Just try to win. Maybe you can.

169
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,989
Of course.

170
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,991
And maybe I can.
I am smart, you know?

171
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:39,827
- And you can hunt.
- Exactly.

172
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,836
To protect you.

173
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,675
Thank you.

174
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,900
You can't tune out again.

175
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:13,862
- I won't.
- No, you can't. Not like when Dad died.

176
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,614
I won't be there anymore.
You're all she has.

177
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,741
No matter what you feel, you have to
be there for her. Do you understand?

178
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,787
Don't cry.

179
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:27,459
Don't cry. Don't. Don't.

180
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,672
- It's time.
- Prim, it's okay.

181
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:35,634
- Prim, it's okay. It's okay, Prim.
- No! No! No!

182
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,677
I promise, Prim.

183
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,613
- I'm fine.
- Yeah, I know.

184
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:57,905
I am.

185
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:02,827
Listen to me. You're stronger
than they are. You are.

186
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,162
- Get to a bow.
- They may not have...

187
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:06,498
They will if you show
them how good you are.

188
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:08,709
They just want a good show.
That's all they want.

189
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,626
If they don't have a bow,
then you make one, okay?

190
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:12,211
You know how to hunt.

191
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:13,547
Animals.

192
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:16,340
It's no different, Katniss.

193
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:21,512
There's 24 of us, Gale.
Only one comes out.

194
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:23,765
Yeah. And it's gonna be you.

195
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:25,392
Okay.

196
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,644
Take care of them, Gale.
Whatever you do, don't let them starve.

197
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:29,770
- Let's go.
- I'll see you soon, okay?

198
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:34,692
You two are in for a treat.

199
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:38,447
Crystal chandeliers, platinum
doorknobs, and it flies.

200
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,699
We'll be at The Capitol
in less than two days.

201
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,242
Now, before you do
anything else...

202
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,259
<i>200 Miles per hour, and
you can barely feel a thing.</i>

203
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:45,096
I think it's one of the wonderful
things about this opportunity,

204
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,724
that even though you're here and even
though it's just for a little while,

205
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,353
you get to enjoy all of this.

206
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:59,443
I'm going to find Haymitch.
He's probably in the bar car.

207
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:13,375
Have you ever met him?

208
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:17,421
Haymitch?

209
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:25,886
You know, Katniss, he is our mentor.
He did win this thing once.

210
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,146
Look, you know, if you don't
want to talk, I understand,

211
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,442
but I just don't think there's anything
wrong with getting a little bit of help.

212
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,925
Congratulations.

213
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:25,489
Where's the ice?

214
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:28,450
I don't know.

215
00:23:34,623 --> 00:23:35,957
May I?

216
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:44,548
Okay, so... So when do we start?

217
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,134
Whoa. So eager.

218
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:50,638
Most of you aren't
in such a hurry.

219
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,224
Yeah. I wanna know what the plan is.
You're our mentor.

220
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:54,643
- You're supposed to go...
- Mentor?

221
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,019
Yeah, our mentor.

222
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,772
You're supposed to tell us how to
get sponsors and give us advice.

223
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:02,942
Oh. Okay. Um...

224
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:07,154
Embrace the probability
of your imminent death.

225
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:14,371
And know, in your heart, that there's
nothing I can do to save you.

226
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,374
So why are you here then?

227
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,625
The refreshments.

228
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:21,169
Okay, I think that's
enough of that.

229
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:29,594
You made me spill my drink.
These are brand new pants.

230
00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:34,682
You know, I think I'll go
finish this in my room.

231
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:52,576
He's gonna come around.

232
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:53,785
It's no use.

233
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:55,787
I'm gonna go talk to him.

234
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:05,838
<i>We have two very fit 16-year-olds.</i>

235
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:09,259
<i>Of course, of course. They always
provide pretty good opponents.</i>

236
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:10,676
<i>Yes, yes, they do.</i>

237
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,636
<i>- Do you remember this year?
- Of course.</i>

238
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:16,307
<i>One of my favorite years.
And one of my favorite Arenas.</i>

239
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:19,310
<i>The use of the rubble
in the ruined city...</i>

240
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,644
<i>Very exciting.</i>

241
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:22,314
<i>And this moment here,</i>

242
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:24,982
<i>this moment is a moment
that you never forget.</i>

243
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:26,401
Yes.

244
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:29,570
<i>The moment when a
Tribute becomes a Victor.</i>

245
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:07,651
- You'd freeze to death first.
- No, because I'd light a fire.

246
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,361
That's a good way to get killed.

247
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:11,028
What's a good way to get killed?

248
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:15,032
Oh, joy. Why don't you join us?

249
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:18,536
I was just giving
some life-saving advice.

250
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:21,498
Like what?

251
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,875
I was just asking about
how to find shelter.

252
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:28,046
Which would come in handy if,
in fact, you were still alive.

253
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:31,799
How do you find shelter?

254
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,801
Pass the jam.

255
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:35,679
How do you find shelter?

256
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,556
Give me a chance to
wake up, sweetheart.

257
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:43,894
This mentoring is
very taxing stuff.

258
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:51,403
Can you pass the marmalade?

259
00:26:52,988 --> 00:26:54,739
That is mahogany!

260
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:58,993
Look at you.
Just killed a placemat.

261
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,747
You really want to know
how to stay alive?

262
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:06,000
You get people to like you.

263
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:08,752
Oh.

264
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:11,172
Not what you were expecting?

265
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:17,470
Well, when you're in the middle of The
Games and you're starving or freezing,

266
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:20,973
some water, a knife,
or even some matches

267
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:23,559
can mean the difference
between life and death.

268
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:27,063
And those things only
come from sponsors.

269
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:31,734
And to get sponsors, you have
to make people like you.

270
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:38,240
And right now, sweetheart, you're
not off to a real good start.

271
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,576
There it is.

272
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:47,208
It's huge!

273
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:49,836
That's incredible.

274
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:16,028
Peeta, I love you.

275
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,830
Come on. Come on.

276
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:35,298
You better keep this knife.
He knows what he's doing.

277
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:47,852
<i>So now that you've seen them,</i>

278
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:50,730
<i>what do you think about this
year's crop of recruits?</i>

279
00:28:50,814 --> 00:28:54,025
Are there any surprises that
we can expect this year?

280
00:28:54,108 --> 00:28:55,652
It's really hard to tell
just from a Reaping,

281
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:59,194
- but I think this is
a very interesting mix. -Yes.

282
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:01,449
And whenever you have a volunteer
from an outlying district,

283
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:03,867
<i>that's something
you can't ignore.</i>

284
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,480
What's that?

285
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:34,982
What's that?

286
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:37,234
We're just saying we might
need to hose you down again

287
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,444
before we take you to Cinna.

288
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:50,205
That was one of the bravest things
I've ever seen. With your sister?

289
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:52,500
- My name's Cinna.
- Katniss.

290
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:55,044
I'm sorry that this
happened to you,

291
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,087
and I'm here to help you
in any way that I can.

292
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,634
Most people just
congratulate me.

293
00:30:01,843 --> 00:30:04,011
Well, I don't see
the point in that.

294
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:08,057
So tonight, they have
the Tribute Parade.

295
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:12,103
I'm gonna take you out and
show you off to the world.

296
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,938
So you're here to
make me look pretty?

297
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,355
I'm here to help you
make an impression.

298
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:19,277
Now, usually they dress people in
the clothes from their district.

299
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,738
- Yeah, we're always coalminers.
- Yeah, but I don't wanna do that.

300
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,240
I wanna do something that
they're gonna remember.

301
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:27,868
Did they explain about
trying to get sponsors?

302
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,663
Yeah, but I'm not very
good at making friends.

303
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:32,332
We'll see.

304
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:36,126
I just think somebody that brave

305
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:41,382
shouldn't be dressed up in some
stupid costume, now should they?

306
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:45,219
I hope not.

307
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:54,479
Okay, this is safe. I promise.

308
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,815
It's not real fire. These suits are
built so you won't feel a thing.

309
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,150
Looks pretty real to me.

310
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,817
Well, that's the idea.

311
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:01,903
You ready?

312
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:04,446
- Don't be afraid.
- I'm not afraid.

313
00:31:24,842 --> 00:31:30,263
Over 100,000 people craning to get
a glimpse of this year's Tributes.

314
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:33,351
<i>And the sponsors get to see the
Tributes for the first time.</i>

315
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,354
The importance of this
moment cannot be overstated.

316
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:42,652
Very nice.

317
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:47,949
First chariot on my
count, in 15, 14, 13...

318
00:31:50,535 --> 00:31:53,954
There they are. There they are.
This year's Tributes.

319
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:56,039
<i>It's the most exciting part.</i>

320
00:31:56,124 --> 00:31:58,041
<i>It just gives you goose bumps.</i>

321
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,252
<i>And don't you love how the stylists,</i>

322
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:04,632
they so clearly are able to reflect
the character of each district?

323
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,719
<i>- Right. Right. There's District 4.
- Yes.</i>

324
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:09,721
<i>- Fishing.
- I get it.</i>

325
00:32:09,804 --> 00:32:11,972
<i>- I like it.
- That's very good.</i>

326
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:17,103
And behind them, we have two
power plant workers. Right?

327
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,563
And then...

328
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,898
What is that in the background?

329
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:49,844
Come on. They'll love it.

330
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:57,934
Yeah!

331
00:32:58,019 --> 00:32:59,479
<i>Now see that?
I love that.</i>

332
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:02,272
<i>Two young people holding
their hands up, saying,</i>

333
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:06,152
<i>"I'm proud I come from District 12.
We will not be overlooked."</i>

334
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,403
- Nope.
- I love that!

335
00:33:07,487 --> 00:33:10,198
<i>People are sure gonna be paying
attention to them right now.</i>

336
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:14,326
And we're ready.

337
00:33:14,535 --> 00:33:15,912
<i>President Snow, you're live.</i>

338
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:47,652
Welcome.

339
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,824
<i>Welcome.</i>

340
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:57,286
<i>Tributes, we welcome you.</i>

341
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:04,335
<i>We salute your courage
and your sacrifice.</i>

342
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,090
<i>And we wish you.</i>

343
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,094
<i>Happy Hunger Games.</i>

344
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:18,431
<i>And may the odds be
ever in your favor.</i>

345
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:33,030
That was amazing.

346
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:35,615
We are all anybody's
going to be talking about.

347
00:34:35,992 --> 00:34:37,367
So brave.

348
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:39,579
Are you sure you should
be near an open flame?

349
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:42,998
Fake flame? Are you sure you...

350
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:54,552
Let's go upstairs.

351
00:34:58,306 --> 00:35:00,432
So, each of the
districts get their own floor.

352
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:03,978
And because you're from 12,
you get the penthouse.

353
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:12,485
Come on.

354
00:35:16,407 --> 00:35:18,617
So this is the living room.

355
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:21,494
I know, I know.

356
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:24,998
Now, your rooms are
right over here.

357
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:28,835
Why don't you go clean yourselves
up a little before dinner?

358
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:50,208
In two weeks, 23
of you will be dead.

359
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:52,253
One of you will be alive.

360
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:56,715
Who that is depends on how well you pay
attention over the next four days,

361
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:59,385
particularly to what
I'm about to say.

362
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:02,554
First, no fighting with
the other Tributes.

363
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,514
You'll have plenty of time
for that in the Arena.

364
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:09,478
There are four compulsory exercises.
The rest will be individual training.

365
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,565
My advice is don't ignore
the survival skills.

366
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:14,233
Everybody wants to grab a sword,

367
00:37:14,317 --> 00:37:17,027
but most of you will die
from natural causes.

368
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,989
10% from infection,
20% from dehydration.

369
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,951
Exposure can kill as
easily as a knife.

370
00:37:56,025 --> 00:37:58,485
- Jason, where's my knife, huh?
- I didn't touch your knife.

371
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:01,155
- I put my knife right there!
- Don't touch me. I didn't touch your knife!

372
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:02,782
- Yes, you took my knife!
- I didn't touch your knife!

373
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,449
- You took my knife, you liar!
- I didn't touch your knife.

374
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:05,534
- You liar!
- I didn't touch your knife!

375
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,744
You little punk!
He took my knife!

376
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,579
- Get off me!
- I'm just sitting here.

377
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:12,248
I'll finish you right now, kid!

378
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:14,043
Actually, better yet,
I'll wait for the Arena.

379
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:15,628
You're the first one I
get, so watch your back.

380
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:22,300
- Everybody, back in line!
- You know who you're messing with, kid!

381
00:38:22,385 --> 00:38:24,762
He's a Career.
You know what that is?

382
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,847
- From District 1.
- And 2.

383
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:30,768
They train in a special academy until
they're 18. Then they volunteer.

384
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:34,063
By that point, they're
pretty lethal.

385
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:36,231
But they don't receive
any special treatment.

386
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:38,818
In fact, they stay in the exact
same apartment as you do.

387
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,903
And I don't think they let them
have dessert. And you can.

388
00:38:43,114 --> 00:38:44,697
So how good are they?

389
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:49,286
Obviously they're pretty good.
They win it almost every year, but...

390
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:50,621
Almost.

391
00:38:50,871 --> 00:38:52,873
They can be arrogant.

392
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:56,960
And arrogance can
be a big problem.

393
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,297
I hear you can shoot.

394
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,302
I'm all right.

395
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:07,929
No, she's better than all right.
My father buys her squirrels.

396
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:12,059
He says she hits them right
in the eye every time.

397
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:15,646
- Peeta's strong.
- What?

398
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:18,148
He can throw a 100-pound sack of flour
right over his head. I've seen it.

399
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:20,608
Okay, well, I'm not gonna kill
anybody with a sack of flour.

400
00:39:20,693 --> 00:39:22,318
No, but you might have a
better chance of winning

401
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:23,653
if somebody comes after
you with a knife.

402
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:26,782
I have no chance of winning!
None! All right?

403
00:39:32,538 --> 00:39:35,081
It's true. Everybody knows it.

404
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:40,420
You know what my mother said?

405
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:43,840
She said District 12 might
finally have a winner.

406
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:46,010
But she wasn't talking about me.

407
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:49,472
She was talking about you.

408
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,686
I'm not very hungry.

409
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:35,851
I'm done, too.

410
00:41:19,061 --> 00:41:20,521
Throw that metal
thing over there.

411
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:21,981
What?

412
00:41:24,692 --> 00:41:27,193
No. Haymitch said we're not
supposed to show our skills.

413
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:28,278
I don't care what Haymitch said.

414
00:41:28,362 --> 00:41:30,405
Those guys are looking at
you like you're a meal.

415
00:41:30,489 --> 00:41:31,574
Throw it.

416
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:17,661
Hi.

417
00:42:18,621 --> 00:42:19,621
Hey.

418
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:21,456
How did you do that?

419
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:25,251
I used to decorate the
cakes down at the bakery.

420
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:27,588
- Oh.
- I'll show you.

421
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:31,257
See?

422
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:33,927
- Wow.
- Yeah.

423
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:37,931
Hey, I think you have a shadow.

424
00:43:03,791 --> 00:43:07,960
Tomorrow, they'll bring you in
one by one and evaluate you.

425
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,923
This is important, because higher
ratings will mean sponsors.

426
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:14,717
This is the time to
show them everything.

427
00:43:14,802 --> 00:43:17,637
There'll be a bow.
Make sure you use it.

428
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:19,472
Peeta, you make sure
to show your strength.

429
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:24,018
They'll start with District 1,
so the two of you will go last.

430
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:28,565
I don't know how else to put this.
Make sure they remember you.

431
00:43:40,077 --> 00:43:42,286
<i>Katniss Everdeen.</i>

432
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,425
Hey, Katniss?

433
00:43:56,009 --> 00:43:57,802
Shoot straight.

434
00:44:58,155 --> 00:44:59,782
Katniss Everdeen.

435
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:02,909
District 12.

436
00:46:29,746 --> 00:46:30,914
Hey, hey, hey.

437
00:46:30,998 --> 00:46:34,501
Hey, who ordered this pig?
Who ordered this pig? Hey!

438
00:46:34,585 --> 00:46:35,878
Did you get some pig yet?

439
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:56,523
Thank you for your
consideration.

440
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:04,447
- Are you crazy?
- I just got mad.

441
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,657
Mad?

442
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:11,454
You realize that your actions reflect
badly on all of us. Not just you.

443
00:47:11,538 --> 00:47:13,081
They just want a good show.
It's fine.

444
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:16,751
How about it's just bad manners, Cinna!
How about that?

445
00:47:16,835 --> 00:47:21,255
Well, finally! I hope you noticed
we have a serious situation.

446
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:27,137
Nice shooting, sweetheart.

447
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:32,643
What did they do when
you shot the apple?

448
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,061
Well, they looked
pretty startled.

449
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:36,313
Oh, yeah.

450
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:40,983
Now, what did you say?
"Thanks for..."

451
00:47:41,068 --> 00:47:42,652
- Thanks for your consideration.
- "...your consideration."

452
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:45,072
Genius! Genius.

453
00:47:45,155 --> 00:47:49,826
I don't think we're gonna find this funny
if the Gamemakers decide to take it out...

454
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:51,369
On who? On her?

455
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:53,664
On him?

456
00:47:53,746 --> 00:47:56,750
I think they already have.
Loosen your corset, have a drink.

457
00:47:57,793 --> 00:48:00,420
I would have given
anything to see it.

458
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:04,173
<i>As you know, the Tributes were
rated on a scale of 1 to 12</i>

459
00:48:04,257 --> 00:48:07,094
<i>after three days of
careful evaluation.</i>

460
00:48:07,302 --> 00:48:10,889
<i>The Gamekeepers would like to
acknowledge that it was an exceptional...</i>

461
00:48:11,431 --> 00:48:16,311
<i>From District 1, Marvel,
with a score of nine.</i>

462
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:19,940
<i>From District 2, Cato,
with a score of 10.</i>

463
00:48:20,023 --> 00:48:22,233
<i>Clove, with a score of 10.</i>

464
00:48:22,317 --> 00:48:25,528
<i>From District 3...
From District 4, with a score of...</i>

465
00:48:25,612 --> 00:48:26,989
<i>From District 7...</i>

466
00:48:27,072 --> 00:48:28,739
<i>From District 8...</i>

467
00:48:29,449 --> 00:48:32,119
<i>And Rue with a score of seven.</i>

468
00:48:32,202 --> 00:48:33,911
<i>Now our final district.</i>

469
00:48:33,996 --> 00:48:38,666
<i>From District 12. Peeta Mellark.</i>

470
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:45,172
<i>A score of eight.</i>

471
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:47,759
- Excellent.
- Peeta!

472
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:48,885
Bravo.

473
00:48:48,969 --> 00:48:51,179
Good job.

474
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:54,974
<i>And finally,</i>

475
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:58,853
<i>from District 12,</i>

476
00:49:01,106 --> 00:49:03,233
<i>Katniss Everdeen.</i>

477
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:08,487
<i>With a score of...</i>

478
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:12,617
<i>Eleven.</i>

479
00:49:14,244 --> 00:49:16,496
- Katniss!
- Outstanding!

480
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:18,039
- Yes!
- Eleven?

481
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:20,208
Congratulations.

482
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:21,626
I thought they hated me.

483
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:23,045
They must have liked your guts.

484
00:49:23,128 --> 00:49:27,257
To Katniss Everdeen,
The Girl on Fire!

485
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:30,177
Goodness. We are.

486
00:49:30,302 --> 00:49:31,510
An 11?

487
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:32,971
She earned it.

488
00:49:33,054 --> 00:49:35,097
She shot an arrow at your head.

489
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:36,474
Well, at an apple.

490
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:37,809
Near your head.

491
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:39,853
Sit down.

492
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:48,195
Seneca, why do you think
we have a winner?

493
00:49:50,697 --> 00:49:52,032
What do you mean?

494
00:49:52,949 --> 00:49:56,702
I mean, why do we have a winner?

495
00:49:59,289 --> 00:50:01,208
I mean, if we just wanted to
intimidate the districts,

496
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:05,878
why not round up 24 of them at
random and execute them all at once?

497
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:07,713
Be a lot faster.

498
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:11,134
Hope.

499
00:50:12,052 --> 00:50:13,177
Hope?

500
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,346
Hope.

501
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:18,307
It is the only thing
stronger than fear.

502
00:50:19,809 --> 00:50:23,605
A little hope is effective.
A lot of hope is dangerous.

503
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:26,983
A spark is fine, as
long as it's contained.

504
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,445
So...

505
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:34,657
So contain it.

506
00:50:37,077 --> 00:50:38,244
Right.

507
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:41,581
<i>So she's staring at all my jewels
She cannot take her eyes off of them.</i>

508
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:42,916
<i>Well, look at all
that you're wearing.</i>

509
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,000
<i>Frankly, it was rude.</i>

510
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:45,168
Oh!

511
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:46,795
Haymitch, you should join us.

512
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:49,338
We're having some of your
favorite for dinner.

513
00:50:49,422 --> 00:50:50,590
Oh, lovely.

514
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:56,554
- Where's Peeta?
- He's in his room.

515
00:50:56,637 --> 00:51:00,516
Now, listen, tomorrow's
the last day.

516
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:03,228
And they let us work with our own
Tributes right before The Games,

517
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:06,106
so you and I will be
going down at 9:00.

518
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,108
What about him?

519
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:13,280
He says he wants to be trained
on his own from now on.

520
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:15,614
What?

521
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:21,161
This kind of thing does happen at this
point. There's only one winner, right?

522
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,713
We should have some
chocolate-covered strawberries.

523
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,630
- Oh, my, yes.
- Please.

524
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:38,179
<i>Ladies and gentlemen
your master of ceremonies,</i>

525
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:40,974
<i>Caesar Flickerman!</i>

526
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:47,521
<i>Thank you! Thank you!</i>

527
00:51:49,065 --> 00:51:54,905
<i>Welcome, welcome, welcome to
the 74th Annual Hunger Games!</i>

528
00:51:56,155 --> 00:52:00,284
<i>Now, in about five minutes,
they're all going to be out here.</i>

529
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,954
<i>All of the Tributes that
you've heard about.</i>

530
00:52:03,038 --> 00:52:04,414
<i>Are you excited?</i>

531
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:06,875
<i>Let me hear it!</i>

532
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:11,463
Amazing.

533
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:14,673
I don't feel amazing.

534
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:16,675
Don't you know how
beautiful you look?

535
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,594
No. And I don't know how
to make people like me.

536
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:21,264
- How do you make people like you?
- Well, you made me like you.

537
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:22,641
That's different.
I wasn't trying.

538
00:52:22,724 --> 00:52:26,728
Exactly. Just be yourself,
I'll be there the whole time.

539
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:30,356
And just pretend that
you're talking to me. Okay?

540
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:31,690
Okay.

541
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:33,777
<i>Let's see if she
does indeed shine.</i>

542
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:37,280
<i>Let's have a warm round
of applause for Glimmer!</i>

543
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:43,494
<i>Glimmer, are you prepared?</i>

544
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:45,829
<i>Yes, Caesar, I am very prepared.</i>

545
00:52:45,914 --> 00:52:48,666
<i>I like it. That's assurance.
That's self-assurance.</i>

546
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:49,960
<i>- Don't you think?
- And, as you can see...</i>

547
00:52:50,043 --> 00:52:51,835
<i>I'm wearing one of
our own creations.</i>

548
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:54,713
<i>A big round of applause!</i>

549
00:52:57,342 --> 00:52:58,342
Marvel!

550
00:52:58,425 --> 00:52:59,427
Whoo!

551
00:53:01,721 --> 00:53:03,181
<i>Welcome, Clove.</i>

552
00:53:03,264 --> 00:53:05,141
- It's an honor representing my district.
- You're a fighter.

553
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:07,643
I'm prepared. I'm vicious.
I'm ready to go.

554
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:10,063
Cato!

555
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:13,650
I find that if I can apply
myself to the situation present,

556
00:53:13,733 --> 00:53:15,025
I will be able to figure it out.

557
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:18,570
<i>Thank you. Lovely to see you.
Thank you so much.</i>

558
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,492
<i>Good. So you can climb trees.</i>

559
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:25,954
You're pretty quick.
And are you a hunter?

560
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:27,621
<i>A gatherer?</i>

561
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,507
<i>From District 12, District 12...</i>

562
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:40,760
<i>You know her as
The Girl on Fire!</i>

563
00:53:43,596 --> 00:53:46,682
<i>Well, we know her as the
lovely Katniss Everdeen!</i>

564
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:04,951
<i>Welcome! Welcome.</i>

565
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:08,788
<i>Welcome.</i>

566
00:54:09,581 --> 00:54:13,126
<i>Well, that was quite an entrance
you made the other day.</i>

567
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:17,297
What?

568
00:54:18,965 --> 00:54:21,092
I think someone's
a little nervous.

569
00:54:22,927 --> 00:54:25,764
I said that was quite an
entrance that you made

570
00:54:25,847 --> 00:54:27,599
at the Tribute Parade
the other day.

571
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:29,851
Do you want to tell us about it?

572
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:34,230
Well, I was just hoping
that I wouldn't burn to death.

573
00:54:42,739 --> 00:54:44,239
When you came out of that chariot,

574
00:54:44,324 --> 00:54:47,827
I have to say, my heart stopped.

575
00:54:48,286 --> 00:54:50,829
Did any of you
experience this as well?

576
00:54:50,914 --> 00:54:52,331
My heart stopped.

577
00:54:55,293 --> 00:54:56,710
So did mine.

578
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:01,800
Now, tell me about the flames.
Are they real?

579
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:03,009
Yes.

580
00:55:07,639 --> 00:55:11,476
In fact, I'm wearing them today.
Would you like to see?

581
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:15,313
Wait, wait, wait. Is it safe?

582
00:55:15,396 --> 00:55:16,688
Yes.

583
00:55:17,023 --> 00:55:18,358
What do you think, folks?

584
00:55:18,483 --> 00:55:19,858
Yeah!

585
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:21,318
I think that's a yes.

586
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:50,556
Steady. Steady.

587
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,059
Lovely. Thank you.

588
00:55:55,478 --> 00:55:58,690
That was really something.
Katniss, that was something.

589
00:55:58,773 --> 00:56:01,150
That was something.
Thank you for that.

590
00:56:03,402 --> 00:56:05,780
I have one more
question for you.

591
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:08,782
It's about your sister.

592
00:56:11,494 --> 00:56:17,583
We were all very moved, I think, when
you volunteered for her at the Reaping.

593
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:22,297
Did she come and say
goodbye to you?

594
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:23,422
Yes.

595
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,550
- She did.
- She did.

596
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:31,431
And what did you say
to her in the end?

597
00:56:34,434 --> 00:56:36,936
I told her that I would try to win.

598
00:56:38,396 --> 00:56:40,773
That I would try to win for her.

599
00:56:41,608 --> 00:56:43,275
Of course you did.

600
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,737
And try you will.

601
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:50,532
Ladies and gentlemen,
from District 12,

602
00:56:50,617 --> 00:56:54,119
Katniss Everdeen,
The Girl on Fire!

603
00:57:00,418 --> 00:57:02,545
You did it, darling.
That was incredible.

604
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:04,047
Thank you.

605
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:06,590
Nice job, sweetheart.

606
00:57:07,342 --> 00:57:08,635
Thank you.

607
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:10,302
Nice dress, too.

608
00:57:11,471 --> 00:57:15,016
<i>- Not yours.
- Please welcome Peeta Mellark!</i>

609
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,190
<i>Peeta, welcome.</i>

610
00:57:23,608 --> 00:57:27,402
<i>How are you finding The Capitol?
And don't say, "With a map".</i>

611
00:57:27,487 --> 00:57:30,114
<i>It's different.
It's very different than back home.</i>

612
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:33,076
<i>Different. In what way?
Give us an example.</i>

613
00:57:33,159 --> 00:57:35,494
<i>Okay. Well, the showers
here are weird.</i>

614
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:36,996
- The showers?
- Yes.

615
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:38,664
We have different showers.

616
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:42,751
I have a question for you, Caesar.
Do I smell like roses to you?

617
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,672
- Take a whiff?
- All right.

618
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:50,217
- You see?
- Yes. Do I smell like it?

619
00:57:57,057 --> 00:57:59,559
- You definitely smell better than I do.
- Well, I've lived here longer.

620
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:00,811
That makes sense.

621
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,943
Very funny. So, Peeta, tell me,

622
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:11,614
is there a special
girl back home?

623
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:13,324
No. No. Not really.

624
00:58:13,574 --> 00:58:17,619
No? I don't believe it for a second.
Look at that face.

625
00:58:17,704 --> 00:58:21,666
Handsome man like you.
Peeta, tell me.

626
00:58:24,043 --> 00:58:25,545
Well, there...

627
00:58:26,045 --> 00:58:29,382
There is this one girl that
I've had a crush on forever.

628
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:34,594
But I don't think she actually
recognized me until the Reaping.

629
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:39,224
Well, I'll tell you what, Peeta.

630
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:44,188
You go out there and
you win this thing,

631
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:47,900
and when you get home, she'll
have to go out with you.

632
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:49,610
Right, folks?

633
00:58:52,864 --> 00:58:56,492
Thanks, but I don't think
winning's gonna help me at all.

634
00:58:56,576 --> 00:58:57,952
And why not?

635
00:59:01,539 --> 00:59:03,750
Because she came here with me.

636
00:59:08,003 --> 00:59:09,588
<i>Well, that's bad luck.</i>

637
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:11,548
<i>Yeah, it is.</i>

638
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:16,596
<i>- And I wish you all the best of luck.
- Thank you.</i>

639
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,056
<i>Peeta Mellark.</i>

640
00:59:20,016 --> 00:59:21,726
<i>District 12!</i>

641
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:26,773
What the hell was that?

642
00:59:26,856 --> 00:59:28,858
You don't talk to me, and then
you say you have a crush on me?

643
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:31,027
You say you want to train alone?
Is that how you want to play?

644
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:32,737
Stop it! Stop it!

645
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:33,987
- Let's start right now!
- Hey!

646
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:38,117
- He did you a favor.
- He made me look weak.

647
00:59:38,201 --> 00:59:42,038
He made you look desirable, which
in your case, can't hurt, sweetheart.

648
00:59:42,121 --> 00:59:43,164
He's right, Katniss.

649
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:44,456
Of course I'm right.

650
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:47,960
Now, I can sell the star-crossed
lovers from District 12...

651
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:49,545
We are not star-crossed lovers.

652
00:59:49,628 --> 00:59:51,380
It's a television show!

653
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:55,217
And being in love with that boy
might just get you sponsors,

654
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,637
which could save your damn life.

655
00:59:58,637 --> 01:00:01,349
Okay. Why don't
you get out of here?

656
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:05,311
Maybe I can deliver you
both in one piece tomorrow.

657
01:00:05,394 --> 01:00:06,813
Manners!

658
01:00:37,885 --> 01:00:39,177
You, too?

659
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:42,347
Hey.

660
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:43,932
Can't sleep?

661
01:00:44,016 --> 01:00:45,726
No. Of course not.

662
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,398
I'm sorry I went after you.

663
01:00:53,025 --> 01:00:55,360
You know, I meant that as a compliment.

664
01:00:55,862 --> 01:00:57,070
I know.

665
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:09,958
Listen to them.

666
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:13,003
Yeah.

667
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,885
I just don't want them to change me.

668
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:24,514
How would they change you?

669
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:31,188
I don't know.
They'd turn me into something I'm not.

670
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:36,443
I just don't want to be another
piece in their game, you know?

671
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:39,989
You mean you won't kill anyone?

672
01:01:42,324 --> 01:01:43,326
No.

673
01:01:44,076 --> 01:01:46,829
- I mean, I'm sure I would,
just like anybody else

674
01:01:46,913 --> 01:01:47,996
when the time came,

675
01:01:49,498 --> 01:01:53,418
but I just keep wishing that I
could think of a way to show them

676
01:01:53,503 --> 01:01:55,253
that they don't own me.

677
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:02,969
If I'm gonna die, I
want to still be me.

678
01:02:08,726 --> 01:02:10,518
Does that make any sense?

679
01:02:10,603 --> 01:02:11,728
Yeah.

680
01:02:13,981 --> 01:02:16,192
I just can't afford
to think like that.

681
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:22,405
I have my sister.

682
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:25,952
Yeah, I know.

683
01:02:40,675 --> 01:02:42,927
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

684
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:47,389
See you tomorrow.

685
01:03:12,498 --> 01:03:17,503
They'll put all kinds of stuff right in front,
right in the mouth of the Cornucopia.

686
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:20,338
There'll even be a bow there.
Don't go for it.

687
01:03:20,422 --> 01:03:21,673
Why not?

688
01:03:21,757 --> 01:03:23,967
It's a bloodbath.
They're trying to pull you in.

689
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,469
That's not your game.

690
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:29,514
You turn, run, find high
ground, look for water.

691
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:31,809
Water's your new best friend.

692
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:36,605
Don't step off that pedestal early
or they'll blow you sky high.

693
01:03:36,688 --> 01:03:37,940
I won't.

694
01:03:49,994 --> 01:03:53,079
Katniss, you can do this.

695
01:04:01,213 --> 01:04:02,422
Thanks.

696
01:04:07,302 --> 01:04:08,929
Give me your arm.

697
01:04:13,184 --> 01:04:14,434
Give me your arm.

698
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,735
- Give me your arm.
- What is that?

699
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:26,989
Your tracker.

700
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:29,532
We're up.

701
01:04:29,867 --> 01:04:31,117
We're up!

702
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:37,500
All right. Less than a
minute, people. Final checks.

703
01:04:37,583 --> 01:04:39,918
There are 15 out. They are flying.

704
01:05:17,498 --> 01:05:18,791
Here.

705
01:05:37,851 --> 01:05:38,853
Shh.

706
01:05:39,103 --> 01:05:40,438
Thank you.

707
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:50,530
Thirty seconds.

708
01:05:57,996 --> 01:06:02,001
I'm not allowed to bet,
but if I could, I'd bet on you.

709
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:15,306
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

710
01:06:27,693 --> 01:06:29,445
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

711
01:06:55,304 --> 01:06:57,597
Okay, they're in the tubes.

712
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:41,934
50, 49, 48, 47,

713
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:46,355
46, 45, 44, 43,

714
01:07:46,438 --> 01:07:49,858
42, 41, 40,

715
01:07:49,942 --> 01:07:53,862
<i>39, 38, 37, 36,</i>

716
01:07:53,945 --> 01:07:58,157
<i>35, 34, 33, 32,</i>

717
01:07:58,617 --> 01:08:02,579
<i>31, 30, 29, 28,</i>

718
01:08:02,788 --> 01:08:06,041
<i>27, 26, 25,</i>

719
01:08:06,125 --> 01:08:09,168
<i>24, 23, 22...</i>

720
01:11:18,984 --> 01:11:23,529
And, of course, there's the
familiar "boom" of the Cannon,

721
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:26,617
which marks the end of
another fallen Tribute.

722
01:11:27,826 --> 01:11:28,827
eight...

723
01:11:29,536 --> 01:11:30,537
nine...

724
01:11:31,997 --> 01:11:32,997
10...

725
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:35,208
11...

726
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:38,045
12.

727
01:13:20,605 --> 01:13:21,606
Twenty-five? Got it.

728
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:27,362
He's moving now.

729
01:14:59,121 --> 01:15:03,207
Well, that makes 13 gone
in the first eight hours.

730
01:15:03,375 --> 01:15:06,670
And Claudius, I think I
see an alliance forming.

731
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:13,844
Wait! Did you see the look on her face?

732
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:15,804
- How stupid can you get?
- A fire?

733
01:15:15,886 --> 01:15:19,349
"Oh, no! Please don't kill me! Oh, no!"

734
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:21,768
That's actually a good impression.

735
01:15:22,144 --> 01:15:23,270
Hey, lover boy!

736
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:27,189
- You sure she went this way?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

737
01:15:28,233 --> 01:15:29,484
You better be.

738
01:15:29,568 --> 01:15:32,529
Yeah, that was her
snare we found back there.

739
01:15:38,243 --> 01:15:40,494
Are you sure we
shouldn't just kill him now?

740
01:15:40,578 --> 01:15:42,413
Nah. He's our best
chance of finding her.

741
01:15:42,872 --> 01:15:44,498
Let's go.

742
01:16:04,978 --> 01:16:06,145
Sir?

743
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:10,442
She is almost at the edge.

744
01:16:10,524 --> 01:16:13,110
<i>Two kilometers away from
the nearest Tribute.</i>

745
01:16:13,194 --> 01:16:14,529
<i>Let's turn her around.</i>

746
01:17:15,215 --> 01:17:18,260
Cueing another. On my count.
One, two...

747
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:32,274
She's heading towards
the left flank.

748
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:34,693
Okay. Can you give me
a tree right there?

749
01:17:34,775 --> 01:17:37,404
Sure. Cueing tree.

750
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:30,789
She's almost there.

751
01:18:44,304 --> 01:18:46,640
Lucia, get a Cannon ready.

752
01:18:58,693 --> 01:19:00,194
There she is! There she is!

753
01:19:02,948 --> 01:19:05,449
- She's mine!
- Not if I get her first!

754
01:19:09,996 --> 01:19:12,122
- Where you gonna go?
- Mine!

755
01:19:12,207 --> 01:19:14,751
Fish out of the pond!
And someone found her.

756
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:23,134
- There she is!
- Yeah!

757
01:19:28,139 --> 01:19:29,599
Here we go!

758
01:19:35,438 --> 01:19:37,815
- Where you going, huh?
- Get her, Cato!

759
01:19:38,024 --> 01:19:39,484
Where do you think you're going?

760
01:19:42,529 --> 01:19:44,405
Where you going, baby?

761
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:46,908
Three o'clock.

762
01:19:49,452 --> 01:19:51,537
- Where you going, Girl on Fire?
- We got her!

763
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:53,163
Miss Everdeen, I'm
gonna get you!

764
01:19:53,247 --> 01:19:54,582
That's not gonna help
you up there, Katniss.

765
01:19:54,666 --> 01:19:56,376
Where are you going?

766
01:19:56,667 --> 01:19:59,212
- Go get her, man!
- You are so done.

767
01:19:59,296 --> 01:20:01,297
Just get her, Cato!

768
01:20:01,381 --> 01:20:03,300
- He's gonna get you, Katniss.
- Look at her scurry.

769
01:20:03,382 --> 01:20:04,384
Right up there.

770
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:06,970
- Kill her!
- Just go, keep going!

771
01:20:08,095 --> 01:20:09,847
- Go, Cato.
- Come on, Cato.

772
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:10,931
- She's right there.
- Go, Cato! Come on, Cato!

773
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:12,057
You got this.

774
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:13,100
Go! He's got this.

775
01:20:13,184 --> 01:20:15,686
- Kill her, Cato! Just get her, Cato!
- Go! Go!

776
01:20:15,770 --> 01:20:17,314
- Take her down!
- Go! Go!

777
01:20:17,939 --> 01:20:19,274
- You got this, Cato!
- Come on, kill her!

778
01:20:19,356 --> 01:20:20,774
I'm coming for you!

779
01:20:20,859 --> 01:20:22,319
Come on, Cato!

780
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:28,158
I'll do it myself.

781
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:36,791
Give me that before...

782
01:20:36,875 --> 01:20:38,917
Come on. Come on, come on!

783
01:20:41,671 --> 01:20:44,048
Maybe you should
throw the sword!

784
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:46,426
Let's just wait her out.

785
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:52,599
She's gotta come down at some point.
It's that or starve to death.

786
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:53,891
We'll just kill her then.

787
01:20:58,063 --> 01:20:59,229
Okay.

788
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:01,733
Somebody make a fire.

789
01:21:12,911 --> 01:21:16,247
- Let's make camp over here!
- Hurry up with the fire.

790
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:15,640
Boys.

791
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:54,905
Thank you.

792
01:24:37,239 --> 01:24:38,240
Psst.

793
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:41,159
Psst.

794
01:25:05,143 --> 01:25:08,645
Claudius, I think those
are tracker jackers Am I wrong?

795
01:25:08,729 --> 01:25:09,730
Oh.

796
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:14,027
- Those things are very lethal.
- Very.

797
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:15,194
For those of you who don't know,

798
01:25:15,278 --> 01:25:20,533
tracker jackers are genetically engineered
wasps whose venom causes searing pain,

799
01:25:20,992 --> 01:25:26,163
<i>powerful hallucinations, and
in extreme cases, death.</i>

800
01:28:25,051 --> 01:28:26,135
Run.

801
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:28,261
Run!

802
01:28:29,514 --> 01:28:30,680
Run!

803
01:28:31,724 --> 01:28:33,100
Katniss, go!

804
01:28:33,935 --> 01:28:36,686
Get out of here! Go!
What are you doing? Go!

805
01:28:48,407 --> 01:28:52,994
Not only is it lethal, but
the venom of a tracker jacker sting

806
01:28:54,037 --> 01:28:55,914
can produce powerful
hallucinations.

807
01:29:56,434 --> 01:30:00,729
Mom, don't just sit there and look at me!
Please say something!

808
01:30:01,314 --> 01:30:03,064
Katniss, go!

809
01:30:04,524 --> 01:30:07,278
Get out of here! Go!
What are you doing? Go!

810
01:31:08,171 --> 01:31:09,256
Rue?

811
01:31:12,969 --> 01:31:15,387
It's okay. I'm not
gonna hurt you.

812
01:31:33,029 --> 01:31:34,532
You want mine, too?

813
01:31:35,573 --> 01:31:37,201
No, that's okay.

814
01:31:38,284 --> 01:31:39,369
Here.

815
01:31:40,328 --> 01:31:41,497
Thanks.

816
01:31:46,543 --> 01:31:48,170
How long was I asleep?

817
01:31:48,962 --> 01:31:52,173
Couple of days. I changed
your leaves twice.

818
01:31:54,385 --> 01:31:55,720
Thank you.

819
01:31:57,430 --> 01:31:59,765
So what happened
while I was out?

820
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:03,101
The girl from 1 and
the boy from 10.

821
01:32:07,148 --> 01:32:09,399
And the boy from my district?

822
01:32:10,317 --> 01:32:13,529
Yeah, he's okay. I think
he's down by the river.

823
01:32:16,907 --> 01:32:18,617
Is all of that true?

824
01:32:18,701 --> 01:32:19,784
What?

825
01:32:20,536 --> 01:32:21,871
You and him?

826
01:32:23,456 --> 01:32:25,457
So where are Cato
and the others?

827
01:32:25,541 --> 01:32:28,586
They got all their
supplies down by the lake.

828
01:32:28,668 --> 01:32:30,837
<i>It's piled up in this
great big pyramid.</i>

829
01:32:31,421 --> 01:32:33,256
That sounds tempting.

830
01:32:49,105 --> 01:32:51,149
Now, this green stuff
is gonna smoke like crazy,

831
01:32:51,233 --> 01:32:53,944
so as soon as you light it,
move on to the next fire.

832
01:32:54,028 --> 01:32:56,529
Light this one last, and I'll
meet you back over there.

833
01:32:56,613 --> 01:32:57,823
Right.

834
01:33:01,118 --> 01:33:04,204
And then I'll destroy their
stuff while they're chasing us.

835
01:33:04,287 --> 01:33:06,539
We need a signal in case
one of us gets held up.

836
01:33:06,623 --> 01:33:07,792
Okay. Like what?

837
01:33:10,086 --> 01:33:11,753
Here. Watch this.

838
01:33:17,467 --> 01:33:20,386
Mockingjays. That's great.

839
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:23,390
Back home, we use them
to signal all the time.

840
01:33:28,311 --> 01:33:29,521
You try.

841
01:33:38,988 --> 01:33:40,698
Okay, so if we hear that,

842
01:33:40,783 --> 01:33:44,286
it means we're okay and
we'll be back real soon.

843
01:33:44,369 --> 01:33:45,621
We're gonna be okay.

844
01:33:51,543 --> 01:33:54,505
Hey, I'll see you for supper.

845
01:33:56,006 --> 01:33:57,966
- Okay.
- Okay.

846
01:34:26,328 --> 01:34:29,707
Guys. Guys, look! Over here.
Come on, come on. Look!

847
01:34:33,877 --> 01:34:34,920
Let's go.

848
01:34:35,337 --> 01:34:38,090
You stay guard and don't
move until we can get back.

849
01:35:06,827 --> 01:35:09,954
I want to see if she's
gonna figure out this booby trap.

850
01:35:10,247 --> 01:35:12,541
Yes. It seems
they've reburied their mines

851
01:35:12,625 --> 01:35:15,211
<i>around that big pile of goodies.</i>

852
01:35:27,430 --> 01:35:30,350
<i>She's certainly figured it out,
hasn't she?</i>

853
01:37:38,186 --> 01:37:40,314
I don't know what happened.

854
01:37:40,396 --> 01:37:43,024
- What the hell happened?
- I don't know!

855
01:37:43,567 --> 01:37:44,568
Our stuff!

856
01:38:41,457 --> 01:38:42,667
Katniss!

857
01:38:44,377 --> 01:38:45,962
Katniss!

858
01:38:47,547 --> 01:38:49,298
Katniss, help!

859
01:38:50,509 --> 01:38:51,926
Katniss!

860
01:38:56,556 --> 01:38:58,934
Katniss! Help!

861
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:01,353
Katniss!

862
01:39:02,479 --> 01:39:03,689
Katniss!

863
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:05,649
It's okay. It's okay.

864
01:39:14,867 --> 01:39:18,244
You're okay. You're okay.
You're fine. See?

865
01:39:47,356 --> 01:39:49,484
It's okay. You're okay.

866
01:39:49,859 --> 01:39:52,445
You're okay. You're okay.

867
01:40:00,037 --> 01:40:02,038
Did you blow up the food?

868
01:40:04,666 --> 01:40:06,210
Every bit of it.

869
01:40:09,546 --> 01:40:10,713
Good.

870
01:40:12,757 --> 01:40:14,635
You have to win.

871
01:40:23,894 --> 01:40:25,561
Can you sing?

872
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:30,567
Okay.

873
01:40:37,990 --> 01:40:41,912
<i>Deep in the meadow.</i>

874
01:40:42,412 --> 01:40:46,082
<i>Under the willows.</i>

875
01:40:46,832 --> 01:40:49,670
<i>A bed of grass.</i>

876
01:40:50,253 --> 01:40:54,298
<i>A soft green pillow.</i>

877
01:40:55,259 --> 01:40:58,052
<i>Lay down your head</i>

878
01:40:58,761 --> 01:41:02,056
<i>and close your eyes.</i>

879
01:41:02,932 --> 01:41:07,938
<i>And when they open, the sun...</i>

880
01:41:56,778 --> 01:41:57,779
I'm sorry.

881
01:41:59,989 --> 01:42:01,490
I'm sorry.

882
01:44:57,667 --> 01:45:00,212
<i>Don't kill her.
You'll just create a martyr.</i>

883
01:45:00,295 --> 01:45:01,587
Well, it seems we've already got one.

884
01:45:01,671 --> 01:45:04,966
I hear these rumors out of District 11.
This could get away from you.

885
01:45:05,050 --> 01:45:06,217
What do you want?

886
01:45:07,092 --> 01:45:08,720
You have a lot of anger out there.

887
01:45:08,804 --> 01:45:11,847
I know you know how to handle a mob.
You've done it before.

888
01:45:11,931 --> 01:45:16,770
If you can't scare them, give
them something to root for.

889
01:45:17,813 --> 01:45:18,814
Such as?

890
01:45:21,774 --> 01:45:23,443
Young love.

891
01:45:24,819 --> 01:45:26,947
So you like an underdog?

892
01:45:27,029 --> 01:45:28,323
Everyone likes an underdog.

893
01:45:28,405 --> 01:45:29,658
I don't.

894
01:45:31,368 --> 01:45:34,453
Have you been out there?
10? 11? 12?

895
01:45:36,081 --> 01:45:37,916
Not personally. No.

896
01:45:37,998 --> 01:45:39,417
Well, I have.

897
01:45:40,585 --> 01:45:42,546
There are lots of underdogs.

898
01:45:42,628 --> 01:45:44,296
Lots of coal, too.

899
01:45:44,631 --> 01:45:47,967
Grow crops, minerals,
things we need.

900
01:45:49,802 --> 01:45:52,055
There are lots of underdogs.

901
01:45:53,055 --> 01:45:55,015
And I think if you
could see them,

902
01:45:56,393 --> 01:45:58,895
you would not root
for them either.

903
01:46:01,355 --> 01:46:02,731
I like you.

904
01:46:06,069 --> 01:46:07,654
Be careful.

905
01:46:18,331 --> 01:46:20,583
<i>Attention, Tributes. Attention.</i>

906
01:46:20,667 --> 01:46:25,505
<i>The regulations requiring a single
Victor have been suspended.</i>

907
01:46:25,588 --> 01:46:27,923
<i>From now on, two Victors
may be crowned,</i>

908
01:46:28,007 --> 01:46:31,677
<i>if both originate from
the same district.</i>

909
01:46:31,761 --> 01:46:34,221
<i>This will be the
only announcement.</i>

910
01:46:35,599 --> 01:46:36,891
Peeta.

911
01:47:37,827 --> 01:47:40,329
Oh, my God!
Peeta! Peeta!

912
01:47:43,416 --> 01:47:44,417
Hi.

913
01:47:48,212 --> 01:47:49,672
It's okay.

914
01:48:04,688 --> 01:48:06,105
What was it?

915
01:48:06,398 --> 01:48:07,690
A sword.

916
01:48:09,317 --> 01:48:10,859
It's bad, huh?

917
01:48:11,987 --> 01:48:13,697
It's gonna be fine.

918
01:48:22,956 --> 01:48:23,957
Ah!

919
01:48:26,376 --> 01:48:27,836
Katniss.

920
01:48:31,506 --> 01:48:32,966
- Katniss.
- No!

921
01:48:34,300 --> 01:48:38,095
I'm not gonna leave you.
I'm not gonna do that.

922
01:48:45,686 --> 01:48:47,104
Why not?

923
01:49:07,332 --> 01:49:09,918
Nobody's gonna find you in here.

924
01:49:10,002 --> 01:49:11,962
They already found me.

925
01:49:16,091 --> 01:49:17,969
We'll just get you some medicine.

926
01:49:18,052 --> 01:49:19,887
Katniss, I don't get many parachutes.

927
01:49:20,846 --> 01:49:22,097
We'll figure something out.

928
01:49:23,182 --> 01:49:24,516
Like what?

929
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:26,935
Something.

930
01:50:28,288 --> 01:50:30,833
- Medicine?
- No. Soup.

931
01:50:31,667 --> 01:50:32,668
I'll do it.

932
01:50:43,345 --> 01:50:44,847
That's nice.

933
01:50:46,850 --> 01:50:48,685
You fed me once.

934
01:50:51,770 --> 01:50:53,689
I think about that all the time.

935
01:50:55,483 --> 01:50:57,402
How I tossed you that bread.

936
01:50:57,484 --> 01:50:59,154
- Peeta...
- I should have gone to you.

937
01:50:59,237 --> 01:51:01,447
I should have just gone
out in the rain and...

938
01:51:04,576 --> 01:51:06,034
You feel hot.

939
01:51:08,662 --> 01:51:10,707
I remember the first time I saw you.

940
01:51:11,957 --> 01:51:13,877
Your hair was in two
braids instead of one.

941
01:51:15,420 --> 01:51:18,463
And I remember when you
sang in the music assembly.

942
01:51:18,547 --> 01:51:20,925
<i>The teacher said, "Who
knows The Valley Song?”."</i>

943
01:51:21,009 --> 01:51:23,136
And your hand shot straight up.

944
01:51:23,219 --> 01:51:24,304
Stop.

945
01:51:24,554 --> 01:51:28,390
After that, I watched you
going home every day.

946
01:51:31,394 --> 01:51:32,729
Every day-

947
01:51:40,569 --> 01:51:42,404
Well, say something.

948
01:51:45,490 --> 01:51:47,911
I'm not good at saying something.

949
01:51:49,828 --> 01:51:51,206
Then come here.

950
01:51:52,873 --> 01:51:54,082
Please.

951
01:52:06,304 --> 01:52:08,180
- Even if I don't make it...
- Shh.

952
01:52:09,097 --> 01:52:10,182
Stop it.

953
01:52:16,439 --> 01:52:18,524
<i>Attention, Tributes. Attention.</i>

954
01:52:19,274 --> 01:52:22,194
<i>Commencing at sunrise, there
will be a feast tomorrow</i>

955
01:52:22,278 --> 01:52:23,863
<i>at the Cornucopia.</i>

956
01:52:23,947 --> 01:52:27,033
<i>This will be no
ordinary occasion.</i>

957
01:52:27,115 --> 01:52:30,869
<i>Each of you needs
something desperately.</i>

958
01:52:30,953 --> 01:52:34,916
<i>And we plan to be
generous hosts.</i>

959
01:52:34,998 --> 01:52:36,542
Your medicine.

960
01:52:36,626 --> 01:52:37,627
You're not going alone.

961
01:52:37,793 --> 01:52:39,878
Yeah? You need it,
and you can't walk.

962
01:52:39,962 --> 01:52:42,715
Katniss, you're not gonna risk
your life for me. I'm not gonna let you.

963
01:52:42,798 --> 01:52:45,801
You would do it for me.
Wouldn't you?

964
01:52:47,761 --> 01:52:49,471
Why are you doing this?

965
01:53:07,990 --> 01:53:10,243
Now there's no way
I'm letting you go.

966
01:53:10,326 --> 01:53:11,327
Peeta...

967
01:53:11,411 --> 01:53:12,619
Please.

968
01:53:13,537 --> 01:53:14,622
Stay.

969
01:53:19,752 --> 01:53:20,877
Okay.

970
01:53:22,337 --> 01:53:23,672
I'll stay.

971
01:54:52,761 --> 01:54:54,096
Oh, God!

972
01:55:25,461 --> 01:55:27,130
Where's lover boy?

973
01:55:29,798 --> 01:55:33,636
Oh, I see. You were
gonna help him, right?

974
01:55:34,302 --> 01:55:38,890
Well, that's sweet. You know, it's too bad
that you couldn't help your little friend.

975
01:55:39,475 --> 01:55:41,810
That little girl?
What was her name again?

976
01:55:42,686 --> 01:55:43,770
Rue?

977
01:55:46,399 --> 01:55:48,443
Yeah, well, we killed her.

978
01:55:49,152 --> 01:55:52,195
And now we're gonna kill you.

979
01:55:58,161 --> 01:55:59,453
You kill her?

980
01:55:59,537 --> 01:56:00,746
- No!
- I heard you!

981
01:56:00,829 --> 01:56:02,747
- Cato! Cato!
- You said her name!

982
01:56:02,832 --> 01:56:04,082
You said her name!

983
01:56:14,844 --> 01:56:16,011
Just this time, 12.

984
01:56:17,180 --> 01:56:18,221
For Rue.

985
01:56:34,529 --> 01:56:37,867
Peeta, I got it.
I got the medicine.

986
01:56:38,158 --> 01:56:39,618
- What happened to you?
- I'm fine.

987
01:56:39,702 --> 01:56:41,119
No, you're not. What happened?

988
01:56:41,328 --> 01:56:43,622
The girl from 2, she threw a knife.
I'm okay.

989
01:56:43,706 --> 01:56:45,457
You shouldn't have gone.
You said you weren't gonna go.

990
01:56:45,541 --> 01:56:47,042
You got worse.

991
01:56:51,213 --> 01:56:52,215
I'm sorry.

992
01:56:53,757 --> 01:56:55,301
You need some of that, too.

993
01:56:55,635 --> 01:56:56,886
I'm okay.

994
01:56:59,889 --> 01:57:01,556
That feels better.

995
01:57:03,184 --> 01:57:05,310
Okay. Now you.

996
01:57:05,603 --> 01:57:08,230
- I'm okay.
- No, come on, you need it, too.

997
01:57:08,314 --> 01:57:09,689
Come on.

998
01:57:09,774 --> 01:57:11,067
All right.

999
01:58:10,585 --> 01:58:11,586
Hi.

1000
01:58:13,087 --> 01:58:15,715
Oh. You're so much better.

1001
01:58:18,509 --> 01:58:19,844
Oh, my God, Peeta.

1002
01:58:20,970 --> 01:58:22,762
I hardly feel anything.

1003
01:58:23,972 --> 01:58:25,682
We could go home.

1004
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:29,103
We could. We're the
only team left.

1005
01:58:29,729 --> 01:58:31,354
We could go home.

1006
01:58:36,152 --> 01:58:37,819
We know Thresh took off.

1007
01:58:37,903 --> 01:58:39,697
Cato's gonna be by
the Cornucopia.

1008
01:58:39,779 --> 01:58:41,823
He's not gonna go someplace
he doesn't know.

1009
01:58:41,907 --> 01:58:44,327
Foxface, she could be anywhere.

1010
01:58:47,037 --> 01:58:50,248
We should probably hunt around here.
We don't have any food left.

1011
01:58:50,332 --> 01:58:51,958
Okay, I'll take the bow.

1012
01:58:54,002 --> 01:58:56,505
I'm just kidding.
I'll go pick some stuff.

1013
01:59:14,731 --> 01:59:15,899
Peeta?

1014
01:59:20,445 --> 01:59:21,572
Peeta?

1015
01:59:24,658 --> 01:59:25,826
Peeta!

1016
01:59:27,036 --> 01:59:28,078
Peeta!

1017
01:59:28,162 --> 01:59:29,287
Are you okay?

1018
01:59:29,372 --> 01:59:31,164
- I heard the Cannon. I thought...
- No.

1019
01:59:31,247 --> 01:59:34,460
That's Nightlock, Peeta!
You'd be dead in a minute!

1020
01:59:34,542 --> 01:59:35,670
I didn't know.

1021
01:59:35,752 --> 01:59:38,088
You scared me to death.
Damn you.

1022
01:59:38,922 --> 01:59:40,256
I'm sorry.

1023
01:59:41,676 --> 01:59:43,051
I'm sorry.

1024
01:59:51,143 --> 01:59:53,311
I never even knew
she was following me.

1025
01:59:53,395 --> 01:59:54,896
She's clever.

1026
01:59:55,146 --> 01:59:56,524
Too clever.

1027
01:59:57,858 --> 02:00:01,028
- What are you doing?
- Maybe Cato likes berries, too.

1028
02:00:07,118 --> 02:00:08,618
What time is it?

1029
02:00:08,703 --> 02:00:10,121
A little after noon.

1030
02:00:10,203 --> 02:00:11,287
Why is it getting so dark?

1031
02:00:11,413 --> 02:00:13,039
Must be in a hurry to end it.

1032
02:00:16,460 --> 02:00:19,003
- You ready, Lucia?
- Right here, sir.

1033
02:00:20,381 --> 02:00:22,091
Well, that's great.

1034
02:00:22,591 --> 02:00:23,967
- Now can you put that in the middle?
- Sure.

1035
02:00:33,144 --> 02:00:36,689
That's it.
That's excellent.

1036
02:00:48,408 --> 02:00:50,077
Did you hear that?

1037
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:23,652
What was that?

1038
02:01:24,779 --> 02:01:26,447
It's the finale.

1039
02:01:41,837 --> 02:01:42,837
Let's go.

1040
02:02:51,907 --> 02:02:52,908
Go.

1041
02:03:10,134 --> 02:03:11,135
Katniss!

1042
02:03:36,659 --> 02:03:37,912
Here!

1043
02:04:50,734 --> 02:04:53,194
Go on. Shoot.

1044
02:04:55,655 --> 02:04:57,865
Then we both go
down and you'd win.

1045
02:05:01,203 --> 02:05:05,623
Go on. I'm dead anyway.

1046
02:05:10,628 --> 02:05:12,381
I always was, right?

1047
02:05:14,800 --> 02:05:16,844
I didn't know that till now.

1048
02:05:20,180 --> 02:05:22,515
How is that? Is that
what they want? Huh?

1049
02:05:24,643 --> 02:05:26,645
- No.
- No, no.

1050
02:05:28,354 --> 02:05:29,731
I could still do this.

1051
02:05:31,233 --> 02:05:33,109
I could still do this.

1052
02:05:34,069 --> 02:05:35,945
One more kill.

1053
02:05:38,198 --> 02:05:40,743
It's the only thing
I know how to do.

1054
02:05:41,076 --> 02:05:43,287
Bring pride to my district.

1055
02:05:46,957 --> 02:05:48,751
Not that it matters.

1056
02:06:05,266 --> 02:06:06,435
Please!

1057
02:06:08,186 --> 02:06:09,188
No!

1058
02:06:15,944 --> 02:06:16,944
Please!

1059
02:07:04,493 --> 02:07:06,994
<i>Attention. Attention, Tributes.</i>

1060
02:07:07,162 --> 02:07:10,582
<i>There has been a
slight rule change.</i>

1061
02:07:10,707 --> 02:07:12,583
<i>The previous revision,</i>

1062
02:07:12,667 --> 02:07:15,921
<i>allowing for two Victors
from the same district,</i>

1063
02:07:16,003 --> 02:07:18,047
<i>has been revoked.</i>

1064
02:07:19,216 --> 02:07:23,345
<i>Only one Victor may be crowned.
Good luck.</i>

1065
02:07:24,512 --> 02:07:27,515
<i>And may the odds be
ever in your favor.</i>

1066
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:43,532
Go ahead.

1067
02:07:47,618 --> 02:07:49,496
One of us should go home.

1068
02:07:50,329 --> 02:07:53,708
One of us has to die.
They have to have their Victor.

1069
02:07:54,292 --> 02:07:55,377
No.

1070
02:07:56,587 --> 02:07:58,005
They don't.

1071
02:07:59,840 --> 02:08:01,048
Why should they?

1072
02:08:02,176 --> 02:08:03,886
- No!
- Trust me.

1073
02:08:04,886 --> 02:08:06,137
Trust me.

1074
02:08:25,032 --> 02:08:26,449
Together?

1075
02:08:27,993 --> 02:08:29,243
Together.

1076
02:08:30,494 --> 02:08:31,579
Okay.

1077
02:08:32,663 --> 02:08:33,832
One...

1078
02:08:36,083 --> 02:08:37,336
Two...

1079
02:08:43,425 --> 02:08:44,635
Three.

1080
02:08:46,302 --> 02:08:47,554
<i>Stop!</i>

1081
02:08:48,346 --> 02:08:49,597
<i>Stop!</i>

1082
02:08:53,060 --> 02:08:56,604
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, may
I present the winners</i>

1083
02:08:57,480 --> 02:09:00,274
<i>of the 74th Annual Hunger Games.</i>

1084
02:09:27,386 --> 02:09:29,304
<i>They're not happy with you.</i>

1085
02:09:29,971 --> 02:09:32,015
Why? Because I didn't die?

1086
02:09:32,474 --> 02:09:34,268
Because you showed them up.

1087
02:09:35,143 --> 02:09:37,938
Well, I'm sorry it
didn't go the way they planned.

1088
02:09:38,020 --> 02:09:40,231
- I'm not very happy with them either.
- Katniss!

1089
02:09:40,856 --> 02:09:43,985
This is serious.
Not just for you.

1090
02:09:44,403 --> 02:09:46,529
They don't take these
things lightly.

1091
02:10:38,414 --> 02:10:40,751
When they ask, you say
you couldn't help yourself.

1092
02:10:40,833 --> 02:10:43,211
You were so in
love with this boy

1093
02:10:43,295 --> 02:10:47,381
that the thought of not being
with him was unthinkable.

1094
02:10:47,548 --> 02:10:51,761
You'd rather die than not be with him.
You understand?

1095
02:10:52,261 --> 02:10:56,725
How did you feel when
you found him by that river?

1096
02:11:01,395 --> 02:11:03,648
I felt like the happiest
person in the world.

1097
02:11:07,778 --> 02:11:10,322
I couldn't imagine
life without him.

1098
02:11:10,613 --> 02:11:11,655
Oh.

1099
02:11:16,994 --> 02:11:18,622
And what about you, Peeta?

1100
02:11:19,747 --> 02:11:21,457
She saved my life.

1101
02:11:21,541 --> 02:11:22,583
We saved each other.

1102
02:11:24,336 --> 02:11:28,840
Ladies and gentlemen, the
star-crossed lovers from District 12,

1103
02:11:28,923 --> 02:11:34,554
this year's Victors of the
74th Annual Hunger Games!

1104
02:11:51,195 --> 02:11:52,697
Congratulations.

1105
02:11:52,780 --> 02:11:54,115
Thank you.

1106
02:11:59,954 --> 02:12:01,372
What a lovely pin.

1107
02:12:01,456 --> 02:12:03,833
Thank you.
It's from my district.

1108
02:12:04,583 --> 02:12:06,877
They must be very proud of you.

1109
02:12:19,682 --> 02:12:22,101
So what happens when we get back?

1110
02:12:23,478 --> 02:12:27,399
I don't know.
I guess we try to forget.

1111
02:12:32,279 --> 02:12:34,155
I don't want to forget.
