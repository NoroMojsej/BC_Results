1
00:02:59,128 --> 00:03:00,797
Goddamn bugs.

2
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:22,193
Oh, shit!

3
00:03:27,198 --> 00:03:28,700
Oh, crap.

4
00:03:41,212 --> 00:03:43,715
Well, Nick the Dick.
What a surprise.

5
00:03:43,715 --> 00:03:45,717
Where you coming from?

6
00:03:45,717 --> 00:03:47,760
Fishing in Cuernavaca.

7
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:50,972
Sure. Let's take a look
at your catch.

8
00:03:51,723 --> 00:03:53,182
Come on.

9
00:04:00,231 --> 00:04:02,525
I would've thrown them back.

10
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,534
What do you get?
100 bucks a head? 200?

11
00:04:11,743 --> 00:04:15,163
Hope you saved it all for your lawyer.
You'll need it.

12
00:04:20,251 --> 00:04:21,753
We'll take it from here.

13
00:04:21,753 --> 00:04:23,254
Who the hell are you?

14
00:04:23,254 --> 00:04:24,756
INS, Division 6.

15
00:04:24,756 --> 00:04:27,258
Division 6?
I never heard of Division 6.

16
00:04:27,258 --> 00:04:28,676
Really?

17
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,179
Who you betting on?

18
00:04:31,262 --> 00:04:33,056
Tough call, Kay.

19
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,802
We've got a winner here.

20
00:05:10,802 --> 00:05:12,303
Oh, I know.

21
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,311
Sir, you can't...

22
00:05:20,311 --> 00:05:21,813
Don't "sir" me, young man.

23
00:05:21,813 --> 00:05:24,691
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

24
00:05:30,822 --> 00:05:33,866
We'll chat with our friend.
You hit the road.

25
00:05:34,826 --> 00:05:37,996
Keep on protecting us from
the dangerous aliens.

26
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:44,836
You ever hear of Division 6?

27
00:05:44,836 --> 00:05:46,838
There is no Division 6.

28
00:05:46,838 --> 00:05:48,339
This is bullshit.

29
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:49,924
Hell, yeah.

30
00:05:50,842 --> 00:05:54,345
Looks like you fell off the bus
in the wrong part of town.

31
00:05:54,345 --> 00:05:57,348
I'll bet you're not
from anywhere near here.

32
00:06:00,852 --> 00:06:02,228
Mikey?

33
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,988
Mikey, when they let you out of jail?

34
00:06:13,364 --> 00:06:14,365
Political refugee.

35
00:06:14,365 --> 00:06:17,410
You know how many treaties
you just violated?

36
00:06:18,369 --> 00:06:20,246
- One?
- Try seven.

37
00:06:22,874 --> 00:06:24,917
You hand me that head.

38
00:06:30,381 --> 00:06:32,759
Put up your arms and flippers.

39
00:06:43,895 --> 00:06:45,229
Shit!

40
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,943
Shoot him!

41
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,476
- "That".
- That....

42
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,815
Was not human. I know.
You got some entrails on you.

43
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:31,484
What the hell?

44
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:33,486
The situation's under control.

45
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,989
Give me your attention for a moment.

46
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:38,282
I'll tell you what happened.

47
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:50,628
This is called a neuralizer.
It's a gift from friends from out of town.

48
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:53,131
This red eye isolates...

49
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:57,010
the brain's impulses,
specifically the ones for memory.

50
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,512
Give me a splay burn on
the perimeter...

51
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:02,015
with holes at 40, 60,
and 80 metres...

52
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:04,434
from right here.
Thank you.

53
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,024
That's good.

54
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:12,817
What's going on?

55
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,527
Excellent question.

56
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:17,613
The answer you're looking for
lies right here.

57
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,993
Who are you, really?

58
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,453
Really?

59
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:26,873
I am just a figment
of your imagination.

60
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,838
Damn, what a gullible breed.

61
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:38,509
I'm serious. You're lucky
to be alive after that blast.

62
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:39,552
What blast?

63
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,554
The underground gas main.

64
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:44,057
You should exercise caution
before firing...

65
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:46,976
I'll tell you that now.
Especially you.

66
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:51,397
Have yourself checked out with EMS
before you leave.

67
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,578
I'm sorry about back there.

68
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,080
It happens.

69
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,831
Didn't used to.

70
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,877
The spirit's willing, Kay...

71
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,255
but the rest of me....

72
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:21,511
They're beautiful, aren't they?

73
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,137
The stars.

74
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,808
We neverjust look anymore.

75
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:34,107
I'll tell you, Kay...

76
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,776
I will miss the chase.

77
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:43,658
No, Dee...

78
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:45,785
you won't.

79
00:09:47,036 --> 00:09:48,454
Freeze!

80
00:09:48,538 --> 00:09:50,206
NYPD! Freeze!

81
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:54,460
All yours, Edwards.

82
00:09:55,545 --> 00:09:57,422
Freeze means stop!

83
00:10:04,053 --> 00:10:05,805
What the hell?!

84
00:10:14,063 --> 00:10:17,066
It just be raining black people
in New York.

85
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:43,593
Do you see this?

86
00:10:43,593 --> 00:10:45,053
N-Y-P-D!

87
00:10:46,095 --> 00:10:48,598
Means I will knock your punk-ass down!

88
00:10:48,598 --> 00:10:50,099
He's coming!

89
00:10:50,099 --> 00:10:53,478
Yeah, and when he gets here,
I'll arrest his ass too.

90
00:10:57,148 --> 00:10:59,609
You trying to catch a beat-down?

91
00:12:06,718 --> 00:12:08,261
What's up?

92
00:12:09,721 --> 00:12:11,222
He's coming.

93
00:12:11,222 --> 00:12:14,225
He's coming because I failed.
Now he'll kill me.

94
00:12:14,225 --> 00:12:16,894
You pissing everybody off today, huh?

95
00:12:18,229 --> 00:12:20,231
You don't understand.

96
00:12:20,231 --> 00:12:22,316
Your world's gonna end.

97
00:12:25,737 --> 00:12:27,405
What are you?

98
00:12:32,744 --> 00:12:35,246
Watch that ledge. Watch the ledge.

99
00:12:35,246 --> 00:12:38,666
Come on down. We'll get those
eyes fixed, don't worry.

100
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,336
Wait a minute.
Let me talk to you!

101
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,762
I work my butt off to make a living.

102
00:12:50,762 --> 00:12:54,265
All I want is to come home to
a fat steak on the table...

103
00:12:54,265 --> 00:12:56,893
but instead I get this.
It looks like poison.

104
00:12:56,893 --> 00:13:00,646
Don't take that away! I'm eating that!
It is poison, isn't it?

105
00:13:01,773 --> 00:13:04,275
I swear, I wouldn't
be surprised if it was...

106
00:13:04,275 --> 00:13:08,154
the way you skulk like a dog
been hit too much, or not enough!

107
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:09,781
I can't decide.

108
00:13:09,781 --> 00:13:11,783
You're useless, Beatrice.

109
00:13:11,783 --> 00:13:15,828
The only thing that pulls its weight
around here is my goddamn truck!

110
00:13:25,797 --> 00:13:27,256
Figures.

111
00:13:36,307 --> 00:13:38,267
What the heck is it?

112
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,938
Get your big butt back in the house.

113
00:13:53,825 --> 00:13:56,536
Place projectile weapon on the ground.

114
00:13:57,328 --> 00:13:59,330
You can have my gun...

115
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,833
when you pry it
from my dead fingers.

116
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:04,127
Your proposal is acceptable.

117
00:14:46,377 --> 00:14:48,379
Edgar, what on earth was that?

118
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:49,756
Sugar.

119
00:14:49,881 --> 00:14:52,258
I've never seen sugar do that.

120
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:55,136
Give me sugar.

121
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:01,934
In water.

122
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:09,776
More.

123
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,280
More.

124
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:31,089
Your skin is hanging off your bones.

125
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:44,227
Is that better?

126
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:16,092
"The perpetrator blinked
two sets of eyelids".

127
00:16:16,092 --> 00:16:18,094
Blinked with both eyes?

128
00:16:18,094 --> 00:16:21,097
He blinked one set,
then a completely different set.

129
00:16:21,097 --> 00:16:23,933
You know, like high beams
and low beams.

130
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,312
Was that before or after he drew
the weapon that you claim...

131
00:16:29,105 --> 00:16:31,107
evaporated into a million pieces?

132
00:16:31,107 --> 00:16:32,692
After, sir.

133
00:16:33,609 --> 00:16:37,280
Why is it that no other officers saw
either of these events?

134
00:16:37,613 --> 00:16:40,616
Some of them are
soggy around the midsection.

135
00:16:40,616 --> 00:16:42,118
They weren't able to keep up.

136
00:16:42,118 --> 00:16:44,537
If you were half the man I am...

137
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,040
I am half the man that you are.

138
00:16:47,623 --> 00:16:49,125
What is your problem?

139
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,626
You're in my face.

140
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:53,629
- I think he threw him off the roof.
- You next.

141
00:16:53,629 --> 00:16:54,630
I wanna talk to you.

142
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,800
Ten minutes,
you take your best shot, tough guy.

143
00:16:58,134 --> 00:17:01,471
Take 10 minutes on a StairMaster,
you pudgy bastard!

144
00:17:07,143 --> 00:17:10,146
I believe you. Laurel Weaver.
Deputy Medical Examiner.

145
00:17:10,146 --> 00:17:12,148
Find me at the morgue. I'll show you.

146
00:17:12,148 --> 00:17:13,483
Wait.

147
00:17:13,649 --> 00:17:15,360
Wait a minute!

148
00:17:15,652 --> 00:17:19,656
You're Dr. Weaver with the coroner's
office working on the John Doe?

149
00:17:19,656 --> 00:17:22,742
- That's right.
- Will you look at this, please?

150
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,167
Some night, huh?

151
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:32,669
Some night.

152
00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:35,004
They were gills, not eyelids.

153
00:17:35,672 --> 00:17:37,965
Gills. He was out of breath.

154
00:17:38,675 --> 00:17:40,176
Who are you?

155
00:17:40,176 --> 00:17:41,678
Did he say anything to you?

156
00:17:41,678 --> 00:17:44,472
He said the world was
coming to an end.

157
00:17:45,181 --> 00:17:46,974
Did he say when?

158
00:17:52,188 --> 00:17:55,191
Would you recognize his weapon
if you saw it again?

159
00:17:55,191 --> 00:17:56,776
Absolutely.

160
00:17:58,194 --> 00:18:00,196
Come on, let's take a ride.

161
00:18:00,196 --> 00:18:03,199
Wait a minute. Look, I got
tons of paperwork...

162
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:04,701
It's all done.

163
00:18:04,701 --> 00:18:05,702
Good work.

164
00:18:05,702 --> 00:18:08,705
You really ran this dude down on foot?
That's tough.

165
00:18:08,705 --> 00:18:10,665
That's double tough.

166
00:18:20,216 --> 00:18:20,800
So who exactly are you with?

167
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,719
So who exactly are you with?

168
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:24,220
FBI? NSA?

169
00:18:25,221 --> 00:18:29,434
I'm part of a bureau that licenses,
monitors and polices aliens on Earth.

170
00:18:29,726 --> 00:18:31,227
Yeah, whatever.

171
00:18:31,227 --> 00:18:32,812
We're here.

172
00:18:34,731 --> 00:18:36,941
This is where we're going?

173
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:38,735
This is Jack Jeebs' spot.

174
00:18:38,735 --> 00:18:41,237
He buys from chain-snatchers.
Doesn't sell guns.

175
00:18:41,237 --> 00:18:42,655
Really?

176
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:44,240
All right, look.

177
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,536
I'm gonna go in and put my thing down,
but when I come out, I want answers.

178
00:18:48,745 --> 00:18:51,080
Okay, go put your thing down.

179
00:18:56,294 --> 00:18:57,795
Officer Eduardo!

180
00:18:57,795 --> 00:19:01,090
How did these get here?
I thought I turned them in.

181
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:04,802
I hear you're into something hotter
than stolen Rolexes.

182
00:19:04,802 --> 00:19:07,805
I deal crack, but I still work here.
I love the hours.

183
00:19:07,805 --> 00:19:10,892
I'm talking about guns, smart-ass!
Weird ones.

184
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:13,978
Come on!
What you see is what I got.

185
00:19:16,314 --> 00:19:18,608
Show him the imports, Jeebs.

186
00:19:19,317 --> 00:19:21,319
Hey, Kay. How are you?

187
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:24,322
- Show him the imports.
- I got out of that business.

188
00:19:24,322 --> 00:19:26,324
Why do you lie to me?

189
00:19:26,324 --> 00:19:27,825
Hold on a second.

190
00:19:27,825 --> 00:19:29,327
I'll count to three.

191
00:19:29,327 --> 00:19:32,330
He'll do it, Jeebs.
That man does not look stable.

192
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:35,333
You know what? He's crazy
when he's like this.

193
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,335
He's always crazy.
Get a massage.

194
00:19:37,335 --> 00:19:39,087
Take a cruise...

195
00:19:39,337 --> 00:19:41,839
- Drop the weapon.
- I warned him.

196
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:42,840
Drop the weapon!

197
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,342
- You warned him.
- I'll kill you.

198
00:19:44,342 --> 00:19:46,344
You insensitive jerk!

199
00:19:51,349 --> 00:19:53,851
Do you have any idea
how much that stings?

200
00:19:53,851 --> 00:19:57,230
Show us the merchandise,
or you'll lose another head.

201
00:20:09,367 --> 00:20:11,119
Mr. Edwards....

202
00:20:15,373 --> 00:20:17,709
There, the one in the middle.

203
00:20:20,878 --> 00:20:24,382
You sold a reverberating carbonizer
with mutate capacity...

204
00:20:24,382 --> 00:20:27,385
to an unlicensed cephalopoid!
You piece of...

205
00:20:27,385 --> 00:20:28,886
He looked okay to me.

206
00:20:28,886 --> 00:20:30,888
It was for an assassination.
The target?

207
00:20:30,888 --> 00:20:32,390
I don't know.

208
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,684
- Goddamn it!
- I don't know!

209
00:20:35,393 --> 00:20:36,894
All that's confiscated.

210
00:20:36,894 --> 00:20:41,232
Be on the next transport off this rock,
or I shoot where it don't grow back.

211
00:20:45,403 --> 00:20:48,614
And I'm gonna be back
to talk about them Rolexes.

212
00:21:10,928 --> 00:21:13,598
Searching for a handle on the moment?

213
00:21:14,932 --> 00:21:16,768
I can't help you.

214
00:21:17,435 --> 00:21:18,936
The only comfort I can offer...

215
00:21:18,936 --> 00:21:22,523
is my promise that tomorrow
you won't remember a thing.

216
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,777
That's not exactly
some shit you forget.

217
00:21:25,943 --> 00:21:28,029
Ever seen one of these?

218
00:21:30,948 --> 00:21:33,409
She looks over to her husband...

219
00:21:33,451 --> 00:21:36,329
then sets it down in her lap
and says:

220
00:21:36,954 --> 00:21:39,749
"Honey, this one's eating my popcorn".

221
00:21:43,461 --> 00:21:44,462
Get it?

222
00:21:44,462 --> 00:21:46,464
This one's eating....

223
00:21:48,466 --> 00:21:50,968
Gotta go.
Thanks for the egg rolls.

224
00:21:50,968 --> 00:21:52,470
Wait a minute.

225
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,471
Who are you?

226
00:21:53,471 --> 00:21:56,474
See what I mean about tequila?
You're very bright.

227
00:21:56,474 --> 00:21:58,476
But you need to lay off the sauce.

228
00:21:58,476 --> 00:22:00,978
I'll see you bright and early, 9:00.

229
00:22:00,978 --> 00:22:02,480
Be there...

230
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,273
or be square.

231
00:22:25,003 --> 00:22:26,838
Well, well, well.

232
00:22:27,005 --> 00:22:30,174
Moving right in, are we?
Think we own the place?

233
00:22:30,508 --> 00:22:32,510
I got an eviction notice for you.

234
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:35,513
Just what exactly
do you think you're doing here?

235
00:22:35,513 --> 00:22:38,016
Taking care of your pest problem.

236
00:22:38,016 --> 00:22:39,684
Pest problem?

237
00:22:40,018 --> 00:22:41,352
Pest?

238
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:44,022
You got a hell of an infestation.

239
00:22:44,022 --> 00:22:46,983
You know, I've noticed
an infestation here.

240
00:22:47,025 --> 00:22:50,028
Everywhere I look, nothing but
undeveloped, unevolved...

241
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:52,530
barely conscious pond scum...

242
00:22:52,572 --> 00:22:55,575
totally convinced
of their own superiority...

243
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:58,077
as they scurry about their short...

244
00:22:58,077 --> 00:22:59,996
pointless lives.

245
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:04,584
Don't you wanna get rid of them?

246
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:06,419
In the worst way.

247
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:43,623
Help you?

248
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:46,125
This dude gave me this card...

249
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,627
Elevator.

250
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:14,195
You're late. Sit down.

251
00:24:21,661 --> 00:24:23,162
My name is Zed.

252
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:25,999
You're all here
because you're the best.

253
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:29,460
Marines, Air Force, Navy SEALs,
Army Rangers, NYPD.

254
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,672
We want one of you.

255
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:34,173
Just one.

256
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:37,176
What will follow is
a series of simple tests...

257
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:40,179
for motor skills,
concentration, stamina.

258
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:43,182
I see we have a question.

259
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:46,394
I'm sorry, maybe you
already answered this but...

260
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:48,688
why are we here?

261
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:49,981
Son.

262
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:53,192
Lieutenant Jensen.
West Point graduate with honours.

263
00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:57,113
We're here because you want
the best of the best of the best, sir!

264
00:25:02,702 --> 00:25:04,704
What's so funny, Edwards?

265
00:25:04,704 --> 00:25:07,165
Your boy, Captain America, here.

266
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:10,209
"The best of the best
of the best, sir!"

267
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:12,045
"With honours".

268
00:25:13,713 --> 00:25:16,215
and has no clue why we're here.

269
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:18,551
That's just very funny to me.

270
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:22,555
Y'all ain't laughing, though.

271
00:25:29,729 --> 00:25:31,773
Okay, let's get going.

272
00:26:56,441 --> 00:26:58,526
Wanna get down on this?

273
00:27:23,468 --> 00:27:25,553
Edwards, what happened?

274
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,513
Hesitated.

275
00:27:29,974 --> 00:27:33,394
May I ask why you felt
little Tiffany deserved to die?

276
00:27:33,978 --> 00:27:36,481
She was the only one
that seemed dangerous.

277
00:27:36,481 --> 00:27:37,982
How'd you figure that?

278
00:27:37,982 --> 00:27:40,985
I was gonna pop this guy
hanging from the light...

279
00:27:40,985 --> 00:27:42,987
but he's just working out.

280
00:27:42,987 --> 00:27:46,491
How'd I feel if somebody bust
my ass while I'm on the treadmill?

281
00:27:46,491 --> 00:27:48,910
Then I saw this snarling beast.

282
00:27:48,993 --> 00:27:51,996
I noticed he had a tissue
in his hand and realized...

283
00:27:51,996 --> 00:27:54,499
he's not snarling,
he's sneezing.

284
00:27:54,499 --> 00:27:56,000
Ain't no threat there.

285
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,502
Then I saw Tiffany.

286
00:27:57,502 --> 00:28:00,505
8-year-old white girl,
middle of the ghetto...

287
00:28:00,505 --> 00:28:03,508
bunch of monsters at night
with quantum physics books?

288
00:28:03,508 --> 00:28:05,510
She about to start some shit.

289
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:08,388
Those books are
way too advanced for her.

290
00:28:08,513 --> 00:28:11,015
If you ask me, she's up to something.

291
00:28:11,015 --> 00:28:13,976
I'd appreciate it if you
eased up about it.

292
00:28:18,022 --> 00:28:20,274
Or do I owe her an apology?

293
00:28:27,532 --> 00:28:29,701
Good shot, though, right?

294
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:36,541
He has a problem with authority.

295
00:28:36,541 --> 00:28:38,001
So do I.

296
00:28:38,543 --> 00:28:41,546
But this kid ran down
a cephalopoid on foot, boss.

297
00:28:41,546 --> 00:28:43,881
That's gotta be tough enough.

298
00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:47,260
Let's hope you know what you're doing.

299
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,562
Gentlemen, congratulations.

300
00:28:57,562 --> 00:29:01,316
You're everything we expect
from years of government training.

301
00:29:01,566 --> 00:29:05,320
If you'll just follow me,
we have one more test to administer.

302
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:07,196
An eye exam.

303
00:29:20,084 --> 00:29:22,045
Where are you going?

304
00:29:23,087 --> 00:29:24,589
What the hell is all this?

305
00:29:24,589 --> 00:29:28,092
In the 1950s, the government
started an underfunded agency...

306
00:29:28,092 --> 00:29:31,095
with the laughable purpose
of establishing contact...

307
00:29:31,095 --> 00:29:33,097
with a race not of this planet.

308
00:29:33,097 --> 00:29:35,516
Look at the end of this device.

309
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,603
Everyone thought the agency
was a joke, except the aliens...

310
00:29:38,603 --> 00:29:42,023
who made contact on March 2, 1961
outside New York.

311
00:29:42,106 --> 00:29:46,194
There were nine of us the first night.
Seven agents, one astronomer...

312
00:29:46,611 --> 00:29:48,613
and a dumb kid who'd gotten lost.

313
00:29:48,613 --> 00:29:51,366
You brought that tall man some flowers.

314
00:29:52,116 --> 00:29:53,618
This way.

315
00:29:54,619 --> 00:29:57,121
They were a group
of intergalactic refugees.

316
00:29:57,121 --> 00:30:01,042
Wanted Earth as an apolitical zone
for creatures without a planet.

317
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:02,627
You ever see Casablanca?

318
00:30:02,627 --> 00:30:04,629
Same thing, except no Nazis.

319
00:30:04,629 --> 00:30:08,049
We agreed and concealed
all evidence of their landing.

320
00:30:09,133 --> 00:30:13,179
So these are real flying saucers
and the World's Fair was a cover-up?

321
00:30:13,638 --> 00:30:14,639
Why hold it in Queens?

322
00:30:14,639 --> 00:30:18,142
More nonhumans arrive every year
and live among us in secret.

323
00:30:18,142 --> 00:30:22,355
Not to change the subject, but when
was the last time you got a CAT scan?

324
00:30:23,147 --> 00:30:26,985
- Six months ago. It's company policy.
- Make another appointment.

325
00:30:27,151 --> 00:30:30,154
Tell your boy Zed I had
an absolutely wonderful time...

326
00:30:30,154 --> 00:30:33,574
and thank you for everything,
but show me the door.

327
00:30:33,658 --> 00:30:36,911
All right. I'm getting some coffee.
You want some?

328
00:30:37,161 --> 00:30:39,288
No, thank you, I'm fine.

329
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,712
How you doing?

330
00:30:45,712 --> 00:30:47,171
Hi, Kay.

331
00:30:47,714 --> 00:30:50,717
- That's not decaf, is it?
- Viennese cinnamon.

332
00:30:50,717 --> 00:30:54,470
Don't tell me we only got powdered
stuff for cream. I hate it.

333
00:30:56,723 --> 00:30:59,100
Well, that's good. Good. Good.

334
00:30:59,726 --> 00:31:02,228
You guys getting along all right?

335
00:31:03,229 --> 00:31:05,189
Don't work too hard.

336
00:31:08,234 --> 00:31:10,695
Sure you don't want some coffee?

337
00:31:16,743 --> 00:31:18,536
Here's the deal.

338
00:31:18,745 --> 00:31:22,248
At any given time, there are
around 1500 aliens on the planet.

339
00:31:22,248 --> 00:31:24,667
Most of them here in Manhattan.

340
00:31:24,751 --> 00:31:27,754
Most of them are decent.
Just trying to make a living.

341
00:31:27,754 --> 00:31:30,673
- Cab drivers?
- Not as many as you'd think.

342
00:31:30,757 --> 00:31:33,760
Humans, for the most part,
don't have a clue. Don't want one.

343
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,347
They're happy. They think
they have a good bead on things.

344
00:31:39,265 --> 00:31:41,976
People are smart.
They can handle it.

345
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:43,269
A person is smart.

346
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:46,981
People are dumb, panicky,
dangerous animals, and you know it.

347
00:31:47,774 --> 00:31:50,777
1500 years ago, everybody knew
the Earth was...

348
00:31:50,777 --> 00:31:53,154
the centre of the universe.

349
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:04,791
Imagine what you'll know...

350
00:32:04,791 --> 00:32:06,417
tomorrow.

351
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:10,713
- What's the catch?
- The catch?

352
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:14,300
The catch is, you will sever
all human contact.

353
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,261
Nobody will ever know
you exist anywhere...

354
00:32:19,305 --> 00:32:20,765
ever.

355
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:26,229
I'll give you to sunrise
to think it over.

356
00:32:31,317 --> 00:32:32,819
Is it worth it?

357
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:34,779
Yeah, it's worth it.

358
00:32:36,322 --> 00:32:38,449
If you're strong enough.

359
00:33:38,384 --> 00:33:40,178
What's up, pops?

360
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:51,397
I'm in...

361
00:33:51,397 --> 00:33:54,817
because there's some
next-level shit going on here.

362
00:33:54,901 --> 00:33:58,404
Before y'all beam me up,
there's a few things to understand.

363
00:33:58,404 --> 00:34:01,783
First off, you chose me,
so you recognize the skills.

364
00:34:02,408 --> 00:34:06,412
I don't want nobody calling me
"son" or "kid" or "sport". Cool?

365
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:07,914
Cool. Whatever, slick.

366
00:34:07,914 --> 00:34:11,376
But I need to tell you something
about all your skills.

367
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:13,544
As of right now,
they mean precisely...

368
00:34:13,544 --> 00:34:15,922
As of right now,
they mean precisely...

369
00:34:15,922 --> 00:34:17,382
dick.

370
00:34:30,436 --> 00:34:33,189
- Purpose of trip?
- Diplomatic mission.

371
00:34:33,439 --> 00:34:34,440
Duration of stay?

372
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,817
Lunch.

373
00:34:35,942 --> 00:34:38,111
Any fruits or vegetables?

374
00:34:50,498 --> 00:34:53,042
You wanna stay away from that guy.

375
00:34:54,002 --> 00:34:55,670
He's grouchy.

376
00:34:56,004 --> 00:34:59,007
Three hours in customs
after a 17-trillion-mile trip...

377
00:34:59,007 --> 00:35:01,009
will make anyone cranky.

378
00:35:01,009 --> 00:35:03,011
What government branch
do we report to?

379
00:35:03,011 --> 00:35:06,014
- None. They ask too many questions.
- Who pays for this?

380
00:35:06,014 --> 00:35:10,309
We hold patents on a few gadgets we
confiscated from out-of-state visitors.

381
00:35:10,518 --> 00:35:13,021
Velcro, microwave ovens, liposuction.

382
00:35:13,021 --> 00:35:15,356
This is a fascinating gadget.

383
00:35:15,523 --> 00:35:19,027
It'll replace CDs soon. I'll have to
buy the White Album again.

384
00:35:19,027 --> 00:35:23,156
That's fun. A universal translator.
We're not even supposed to have it.

385
00:35:23,531 --> 00:35:26,534
Human thought is so primitive.
It's looked upon...

386
00:35:26,534 --> 00:35:29,037
as an infectious disease
in some galaxies.

387
00:35:29,037 --> 00:35:31,039
That kind of makes you proud.

388
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:32,665
What's this?

389
00:35:36,044 --> 00:35:37,545
Just be calm!

390
00:35:37,545 --> 00:35:38,921
Relax!

391
00:35:39,547 --> 00:35:41,049
Watch your head!

392
00:35:41,049 --> 00:35:43,217
Someone get him some ice!

393
00:35:44,052 --> 00:35:47,305
Look out! Move! Just move
when it's coming at you!

394
00:35:53,061 --> 00:35:54,395
Damn!

395
00:35:54,562 --> 00:35:56,439
I'll pay for that!

396
00:36:07,575 --> 00:36:10,620
This thing caused
the 1977 New York blackout.

397
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:14,082
Practical joke
by the Great Attractor.

398
00:36:14,082 --> 00:36:16,209
He thought it was funny.

399
00:36:17,085 --> 00:36:18,753
Sorry, y'all.

400
00:36:19,087 --> 00:36:21,255
It was a accident. Sorry.

401
00:36:21,589 --> 00:36:24,092
Observation,
the heart of our endeavour.

402
00:36:24,092 --> 00:36:26,511
Meet the twins, Blblup and Bob.

403
00:36:26,594 --> 00:36:29,931
This map shows the location
of every alien on Earth.

404
00:36:30,098 --> 00:36:32,600
Some are under constant surveillance.

405
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,602
Everyone on those screens is an alien.

406
00:36:34,602 --> 00:36:38,106
In public, they're as normal
as you are, but in private....

407
00:36:38,106 --> 00:36:40,066
You'll get the idea.

408
00:36:40,608 --> 00:36:42,068
Oh, man.

409
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:44,487
Doesn't make any sense, right?

410
00:36:45,113 --> 00:36:47,615
Well, no, it makes perfect sense.

411
00:36:48,116 --> 00:36:51,619
In third grade, everyone said
I was crazy, but I knew our teacher...

412
00:36:51,619 --> 00:36:54,122
had to be from Venus or something.

413
00:36:54,122 --> 00:36:57,583
Ms. Edelson. Jupiter, actually.
Well, one of the moons.

414
00:36:58,626 --> 00:36:59,627
revolve.

415
00:36:59,627 --> 00:37:01,087
Class...

416
00:37:01,629 --> 00:37:04,007
be quiet and pay attention!

417
00:37:04,632 --> 00:37:06,634
If I have to tell you...

418
00:37:06,634 --> 00:37:08,594
one more time....

419
00:37:10,638 --> 00:37:12,432
Let's put it on.

420
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,142
Put what on?

421
00:37:14,142 --> 00:37:16,561
The last suit you'll ever wear.

422
00:37:29,157 --> 00:37:32,160
You will dress only in attire
specially sanctioned...

423
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,412
by MiB Special Services.

424
00:37:34,662 --> 00:37:37,665
You'll conform to
the identity we give you...

425
00:37:37,665 --> 00:37:40,793
eat where we tellyou,
live where we tellyou.

426
00:37:41,169 --> 00:37:42,170
From now on...

427
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:45,173
you'll have no identifying
marks ofany kind.

428
00:37:45,173 --> 00:37:47,717
You will not stand out in any way.

429
00:37:48,176 --> 00:37:50,178
Your entire image is crafted...

430
00:37:50,178 --> 00:37:53,473
to leave no lasting memory
with anyone you meet.

431
00:37:53,681 --> 00:37:56,184
You are a rumour,
recognizable only as...

432
00:37:56,184 --> 00:37:59,062
dej. vu and dismissed
just as quickly.

433
00:37:59,187 --> 00:38:01,856
You don't exist.
You were neverborn.

434
00:38:04,192 --> 00:38:06,235
Anonymity is yourname.

435
00:38:06,694 --> 00:38:08,946
Silence, yournative tongue.

436
00:38:09,197 --> 00:38:11,699
You're no longerpart ofthe system.

437
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:14,202
You are above the system. Over it.

438
00:38:14,202 --> 00:38:15,745
Beyond it.

439
00:38:17,205 --> 00:38:19,624
We're "them". We're "they".

440
00:38:19,707 --> 00:38:21,834
We are the Men in Black.

441
00:38:29,217 --> 00:38:32,512
You know what the difference is
between you and me?

442
00:38:35,223 --> 00:38:37,266
I make this look good.

443
00:38:39,268 --> 00:38:41,771
We're gonna go for a little ride.

444
00:38:41,771 --> 00:38:45,692
I'll put you down here for a minute,
and Daddy will be right back.

445
00:39:16,806 --> 00:39:19,809
Okay, now we're ready to go
for a little ride.

446
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:23,271
We'll meet one of Daddy's friends,
and you'll like him.

447
00:39:26,316 --> 00:39:28,109
Okay, let's see.

448
00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:32,572
Bee, we got the deposed sur-prefect
of Singalee...

449
00:39:32,822 --> 00:39:35,825
touching down in the forest
outside Portland tonight.

450
00:39:35,825 --> 00:39:38,536
- Humanoid?
- You wish. Bring a sponge.

451
00:39:39,829 --> 00:39:42,332
Here. Red letter from last night.

452
00:39:42,832 --> 00:39:45,835
We had an unauthorized landing
in upstate New York.

453
00:39:45,835 --> 00:39:47,837
Keep your ears open
on this one.

454
00:39:47,837 --> 00:39:51,174
We're not hosting an
intergalactic kegger down here.

455
00:39:53,343 --> 00:39:55,178
We got a skimmer.

456
00:39:55,345 --> 00:39:57,347
Landed alien out of zone.
Who is it?

457
00:39:57,347 --> 00:39:58,806
Redgick.

458
00:39:58,848 --> 00:40:01,851
He's not cleared to leave Manhattan,
but he's out of town...

459
00:40:01,851 --> 00:40:04,354
stuck on the New Jersey turnpike.

460
00:40:04,354 --> 00:40:06,356
Take junior with you.

461
00:40:06,356 --> 00:40:09,233
This is a good one
for him to warm up on.

462
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,235
Go get him, tiger.

463
00:40:17,367 --> 00:40:20,453
"We're not hosting
an intergalactic kegger".

464
00:40:21,371 --> 00:40:22,789
Zed....

465
00:40:23,873 --> 00:40:25,458
He just....

466
00:40:26,376 --> 00:40:30,380
Unlimited technology from the
whole universe, and we cruise around...

467
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,215
in a Ford POS.

468
00:40:34,384 --> 00:40:36,427
Fasten your seat belt.

469
00:40:36,886 --> 00:40:38,888
We gotta work on your people skills.

470
00:40:38,888 --> 00:40:41,891
You'd get a better reaction
if you were polite.

471
00:40:41,891 --> 00:40:43,393
Fasten your seat belt, please.

472
00:40:43,393 --> 00:40:45,687
Good. Did you hurt yourself?

473
00:40:48,898 --> 00:40:52,527
The red button there, kid.
Don't ever touch the red button.

474
00:41:02,912 --> 00:41:05,623
All right, pop,
that'll be $72 there.

475
00:41:05,915 --> 00:41:09,002
Okay, sweetie, let me pay
the impolite driver.

476
00:42:12,482 --> 00:42:14,025
Six is up!

477
00:42:14,984 --> 00:42:16,486
Where is lvan?

478
00:42:16,486 --> 00:42:18,321
Gave him a break.

479
00:42:41,052 --> 00:42:44,514
You can kill us both,
but you will not find the Galaxy.

480
00:42:45,056 --> 00:42:47,392
You're right about one thing.

481
00:43:01,572 --> 00:43:03,783
You're not going anywhere.

482
00:43:20,591 --> 00:43:23,302
Your licence and registration, please.

483
00:43:26,097 --> 00:43:29,600
Like to see your other licence
and registration, please.

484
00:43:36,607 --> 00:43:40,278
You're restricted to Manhattan.
Where are you going, Redgie?

485
00:43:41,112 --> 00:43:43,740
It's my wife. She's....
Well, look.

486
00:43:48,619 --> 00:43:49,620
No big deal.

487
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,998
Okay, you come with me, Redge.

488
00:43:54,125 --> 00:43:56,085
And you handle this.

489
00:43:56,627 --> 00:43:58,129
What?! Me?

490
00:43:58,129 --> 00:44:00,631
- You just catch.
- Does he know what he's doing?

491
00:44:00,631 --> 00:44:03,384
He does it all the time.
Let him work.

492
00:44:11,643 --> 00:44:13,186
Damn, man!

493
00:44:14,145 --> 00:44:16,105
Something's peeking!

494
00:44:17,148 --> 00:44:19,150
You're headed out of town.

495
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:21,527
- We're meeting someone.
- Who?

496
00:44:21,653 --> 00:44:24,656
- It's a ship.
- I saw no departure clearance.

497
00:44:25,156 --> 00:44:26,157
You didn't?

498
00:44:26,157 --> 00:44:28,034
It's an emergency.

499
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,662
You're doing fine!

500
00:44:30,662 --> 00:44:34,415
What kind of emergency?
What's the rush to get off the planet?

501
00:44:35,166 --> 00:44:37,168
We don't like
the neighbourhood anymore.

502
00:44:37,168 --> 00:44:39,462
Some of the new arrivals....

503
00:44:39,671 --> 00:44:43,174
New arrivals? Have anything to do
with the crasher last night?

504
00:44:43,174 --> 00:44:44,967
Excuse me, miss!

505
00:44:48,179 --> 00:44:49,639
Oh, man.

506
00:44:50,181 --> 00:44:51,641
Oh, man!

507
00:44:53,685 --> 00:44:55,019
Look.

508
00:44:55,186 --> 00:44:56,646
Oh, man!

509
00:44:58,189 --> 00:45:00,733
Congratulations, Redge.
It's a...

510
00:45:01,192 --> 00:45:02,694
squid.

511
00:45:06,197 --> 00:45:08,032
You know, it's...

512
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:10,243
actually kind of...

513
00:45:16,207 --> 00:45:17,667
cute.

514
00:45:25,216 --> 00:45:27,719
Anything about that seem unusual?

515
00:45:30,221 --> 00:45:32,223
What would scare Redgick so badly...

516
00:45:32,223 --> 00:45:34,726
that he'd risk a warp jump
with a newborn?

517
00:45:34,726 --> 00:45:36,978
We'll check the hot sheets.

518
00:45:42,734 --> 00:45:43,735
These are "hot sheets"?

519
00:45:43,735 --> 00:45:46,237
Best investigative reporting on Earth.

520
00:45:46,237 --> 00:45:49,741
Read The New York Times if you want.
They get lucky sometimes.

521
00:45:49,741 --> 00:45:53,703
Cannot believe you're looking for tips
in the supermarket tabloids.

522
00:45:54,746 --> 00:45:56,706
Not "looking for".

523
00:45:57,248 --> 00:45:58,624
Found.

524
00:46:12,764 --> 00:46:15,266
- Wait a minute, slow down.
- Why?

525
00:46:15,266 --> 00:46:18,978
Give her time to get the wrong
impression. Makes it smoother.

526
00:46:19,771 --> 00:46:21,272
Can I help you?

527
00:46:21,272 --> 00:46:24,776
Yes, ma'am. I'm Agent Manheim,
this is Agent Black, FBI.

528
00:46:24,776 --> 00:46:26,778
We'd like to talk about your visitor.

529
00:46:26,778 --> 00:46:28,279
Gonna make fun of me too?

530
00:46:28,279 --> 00:46:32,283
No, we do not have a sense of humour
we're aware of. May we come in?

531
00:46:34,285 --> 00:46:35,620
Sure.

532
00:46:35,828 --> 00:46:37,330
- Thank you.
- Lemonade?

533
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:39,123
Oh, yes, please.

534
00:46:43,336 --> 00:46:45,838
The chief of police came
to the house...

535
00:46:45,838 --> 00:46:48,132
and did an investigation.

536
00:46:48,341 --> 00:46:51,803
Took a police report and writ down
everything I said...

537
00:46:51,844 --> 00:46:53,846
not believing one thing I said.

538
00:46:53,846 --> 00:46:55,848
Sort of poking fun at me.

539
00:46:55,848 --> 00:46:57,850
He asked me, "If he was murdered...

540
00:46:57,850 --> 00:47:00,853
how was he able to walk
back in the house?"

541
00:47:00,853 --> 00:47:03,856
I gotta admit to you that
that one got me stumped.

542
00:47:03,856 --> 00:47:07,026
I tell you, I know Edgar,
and that wasn't Edgar.

543
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:10,697
It was like something was
wearing Edgar.

544
00:47:12,865 --> 00:47:14,575
Like a suit...

545
00:47:14,867 --> 00:47:16,703
an Edgar suit.

546
00:47:23,876 --> 00:47:26,796
Dude was that ugly
before he was an alien.

547
00:47:29,382 --> 00:47:30,925
I'm sorry.

548
00:47:31,884 --> 00:47:33,261
Go on.

549
00:47:33,886 --> 00:47:35,388
Anyway...

550
00:47:35,388 --> 00:47:37,640
I come to and he's gone.

551
00:47:38,391 --> 00:47:39,392
He say anything?

552
00:47:39,392 --> 00:47:41,853
Yes. He asked me for some water.

553
00:47:42,895 --> 00:47:44,731
Some sugar water.

554
00:47:45,398 --> 00:47:46,399
Sugar water?

555
00:47:46,399 --> 00:47:49,777
I remember that right.
I thought that that was odd...

556
00:47:49,902 --> 00:47:53,906
that he asked me for sugar water
and not lemonade or ice water...

557
00:47:54,407 --> 00:47:55,908
or regular water...

558
00:47:55,908 --> 00:47:57,577
tap water.

559
00:47:58,411 --> 00:48:01,247
All right, Beatrice.
There was no alien.

560
00:48:01,414 --> 00:48:03,916
The flash of light was not a U.F.O.

561
00:48:03,916 --> 00:48:08,046
Gas was trapped in a thermal pocket
and refracted the light from Venus.

562
00:48:08,421 --> 00:48:09,922
Wait a minute.

563
00:48:09,922 --> 00:48:13,426
That thing erases her memory,
and you just make up a new one?

564
00:48:13,426 --> 00:48:15,428
A standard-issue neuralizer.

565
00:48:15,428 --> 00:48:18,431
That weak-ass story is
the best you came up with?

566
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:21,100
All right. On a more personal note...

567
00:48:21,434 --> 00:48:25,438
Edgar ran off with an old girlfriend.
You'll stay with your mama...

568
00:48:25,438 --> 00:48:26,939
and decide you're better off.

569
00:48:26,939 --> 00:48:30,026
Yeah, because he never
appreciated you anyway.

570
00:48:31,444 --> 00:48:33,446
In fact, you know what?

571
00:48:33,446 --> 00:48:36,449
You kicked him out.
And now that he's gone...

572
00:48:36,449 --> 00:48:39,869
you'll go in town,
find yourself some nice dresses.

573
00:48:39,952 --> 00:48:43,748
Get yourself some shoes.
Find somewhere you could get a facial.

574
00:48:45,458 --> 00:48:49,045
And hire a decorator to come
in here quick because...damn!

575
00:48:57,011 --> 00:48:59,013
When do I get my own flashy...

576
00:48:59,013 --> 00:49:00,515
memory messer-upper?

577
00:49:00,515 --> 00:49:02,350
When you grow up.

578
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,397
Please. Not green.

579
00:49:07,522 --> 00:49:09,023
Oh, damn!

580
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:13,903
Do you know which alien leaves
a green spectral trail...

581
00:49:13,903 --> 00:49:16,114
and craves sugar water?

582
00:49:16,406 --> 00:49:20,034
That was on Jeopardy last night.
Damn, Alex said it was....

583
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:22,328
Zed, we have a bug.

584
00:49:22,912 --> 00:49:25,415
So....
What? We don't like bugs?

585
00:49:25,915 --> 00:49:28,292
Bugs thrive on carnage, tiger.

586
00:49:28,418 --> 00:49:32,380
They consume, infest, destroy,
live off the death of other species.

587
00:49:32,922 --> 00:49:35,425
You were stung as a child, right?

588
00:49:35,925 --> 00:49:39,262
lmagine a giant cockroach
with unlimited strength...

589
00:49:39,929 --> 00:49:43,433
a massive inferiority complex,
and a real short temper...

590
00:49:43,433 --> 00:49:46,894
is terrorizing Manhattan Island
in a new Edgar suit.

591
00:49:47,937 --> 00:49:49,897
That sound like fun?

592
00:49:51,441 --> 00:49:53,234
What's the move?

593
00:49:53,943 --> 00:49:56,946
With a bug in town,
we'll watch the morgues.

594
00:50:08,458 --> 00:50:10,460
Where do you want
contestant number 3?

595
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:12,420
Just leave it there.

596
00:50:12,462 --> 00:50:13,463
What's with the cat?

597
00:50:13,463 --> 00:50:16,382
There's a problem with the cat.
Sign here.

598
00:50:16,966 --> 00:50:20,345
- What's the problem with the cat?
- It's your problem.

599
00:50:22,972 --> 00:50:24,849
I hate the living.

600
00:50:26,476 --> 00:50:27,977
Shall we?

601
00:50:57,548 --> 00:50:59,133
Oh, my God!

602
00:51:03,554 --> 00:51:05,515
Buddy, what are you?

603
00:51:14,065 --> 00:51:17,568
Subject was approximately 112 degrees
at time of autopsy...

604
00:51:17,568 --> 00:51:20,071
indicating a temperature increase.

605
00:51:20,071 --> 00:51:24,158
Examiner tried to verify this rectally,
but the subject had no rectum.

606
00:51:24,575 --> 00:51:26,077
Which is really...

607
00:51:26,077 --> 00:51:27,453
Weird.

608
00:51:27,578 --> 00:51:31,624
I'm Dr. Leo Manville, Department
of Public Health. This is Dr. White.

609
00:51:33,084 --> 00:51:35,086
You must not have a home life.

610
00:51:35,086 --> 00:51:38,589
We watch the morgues carefully.
You have something unusual?

611
00:51:38,589 --> 00:51:40,883
I'd say so. Triple homicide.

612
00:51:41,092 --> 00:51:43,344
The first body was normal,
except he was broken in half.

613
00:51:43,344 --> 00:51:44,595
The first body was normal,
except he was broken in half.

614
00:51:44,595 --> 00:51:47,598
But when I opened up
the other two, well....

615
00:51:47,598 --> 00:51:49,392
Let me show you.

616
00:51:55,606 --> 00:51:58,609
There's a skeletal structure
unlike anything I've seen.

617
00:51:58,609 --> 00:52:00,611
I'll have a look at it.

618
00:52:00,611 --> 00:52:02,613
You and Dr. Weaver
check the other body.

619
00:52:02,613 --> 00:52:04,449
This way, doctor.

620
00:52:05,116 --> 00:52:07,285
This one's even stranger.

621
00:52:07,618 --> 00:52:10,621
I did a laparotomy.
I started with the stomach.

622
00:52:10,621 --> 00:52:13,958
But we can start with the
gastroesophageal junction.

623
00:52:15,126 --> 00:52:17,754
Let's start wherever you started at.

624
00:52:18,629 --> 00:52:20,214
Okey-dokey.

625
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,642
- Is this your cat?
- It is now.

626
00:52:30,642 --> 00:52:33,144
It came in with the body.
Dive right in.

627
00:52:33,144 --> 00:52:35,229
I'm sure he won't mind.

628
00:52:38,149 --> 00:52:40,443
You have really pretty eyes.

629
00:52:41,152 --> 00:52:42,695
Thank you.

630
00:52:46,157 --> 00:52:47,158
Feel that?

631
00:52:47,158 --> 00:52:50,453
Where the pyloric junction would be?
Push it aside.

632
00:52:50,662 --> 00:52:53,915
Notice anything strange?
Stomach, liver, lungs....

633
00:52:54,165 --> 00:52:55,917
Nope, all fine.

634
00:52:56,167 --> 00:52:58,127
They're all missing.

635
00:52:58,670 --> 00:52:59,671
Of course.

636
00:52:59,671 --> 00:53:02,632
That's obviously
the first thing I noticed.

637
00:53:03,174 --> 00:53:06,678
What I was pointing out
is the fact that there are no...

638
00:53:07,178 --> 00:53:08,805
pieces...

639
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:10,682
of them left.

640
00:53:10,682 --> 00:53:13,059
You know, so they're intact...

641
00:53:14,185 --> 00:53:17,480
wherever they are whole.
That we can be sure of.

642
00:53:17,689 --> 00:53:19,607
Have we met before?

643
00:53:19,691 --> 00:53:22,151
I'm having a feeling of deja vu.

644
00:53:23,194 --> 00:53:25,321
- Yeah, me too.
- Really?

645
00:53:26,698 --> 00:53:29,200
Wanna know what I think?
Don't tell him.

646
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,704
He's under enough stress.
I don't think it's a real body.

647
00:53:32,704 --> 00:53:36,207
I think it's some kind of
transport unit for something else.

648
00:53:36,207 --> 00:53:38,251
The question is, what?

649
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:41,379
Is this freaking you out?

650
00:53:43,715 --> 00:53:45,216
No, girl.

651
00:53:46,217 --> 00:53:49,554
You know what I like to do sometimes
when it's late?

652
00:53:53,725 --> 00:53:55,268
Dr. White.

653
00:53:56,728 --> 00:53:58,271
Excuse me.

654
00:54:02,734 --> 00:54:04,610
What do you think?

655
00:54:04,736 --> 00:54:08,239
Interesting. She got
a "Queen of the Undead" thing going...

656
00:54:08,239 --> 00:54:09,741
Of the body.

657
00:54:09,741 --> 00:54:10,742
Great body.

658
00:54:10,742 --> 00:54:12,452
The dead body.

659
00:54:13,244 --> 00:54:15,246
You have to look at that thing.

660
00:54:15,246 --> 00:54:17,123
You recognize him?

661
00:54:17,749 --> 00:54:21,252
He looks like the big guy I saw
at headquarters, only deader.

662
00:54:21,252 --> 00:54:23,046
What killed him?

663
00:54:23,755 --> 00:54:25,131
A bug?

664
00:54:25,757 --> 00:54:27,675
You're up, slugger.

665
00:54:31,304 --> 00:54:32,972
Look at this.

666
00:54:34,307 --> 00:54:36,351
What the hell is that?

667
00:54:54,327 --> 00:54:55,787
Must....

668
00:54:57,330 --> 00:54:58,998
To prevent...

669
00:55:01,834 --> 00:55:03,419
contest.

670
00:55:04,337 --> 00:55:06,297
What are you saying?

671
00:55:06,339 --> 00:55:07,840
To prevent....

672
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,509
To prevent...

673
00:55:09,842 --> 00:55:11,469
struggle?

674
00:55:13,346 --> 00:55:14,847
To prevent....

675
00:55:14,847 --> 00:55:15,848
War?

676
00:55:15,848 --> 00:55:17,141
War.

677
00:55:19,852 --> 00:55:21,521
The Galaxy...

678
00:55:22,855 --> 00:55:24,440
is on...

679
00:55:24,857 --> 00:55:26,526
Orion's...

680
00:55:29,362 --> 00:55:30,780
be...

681
00:55:33,366 --> 00:55:35,034
What is word?

682
00:55:35,368 --> 00:55:36,828
The bed?

683
00:55:36,869 --> 00:55:38,788
Belt? Orion's belt?

684
00:55:59,392 --> 00:56:02,645
"To prevent war, the Galaxy
is on Orion's belt".

685
00:56:02,895 --> 00:56:05,231
What the hell does that mean?

686
00:56:08,401 --> 00:56:09,902
Doctor...

687
00:56:09,902 --> 00:56:11,404
whatever, come here.

688
00:56:11,404 --> 00:56:15,366
Dr. Whatever? You guys aren't really
from the Department of Health.

689
00:56:15,908 --> 00:56:17,702
Rosenberg. Damn!

690
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:21,748
The Arquillians won't like this.
He was one of the royal family.

691
00:56:22,415 --> 00:56:23,916
This is an alien...

692
00:56:23,916 --> 00:56:27,420
and you're from a government agency
keeping it under wraps.

693
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:30,923
He said, "To prevent war,
the Galaxy is on Orion's belt".

694
00:56:30,923 --> 00:56:33,426
How else do you explain New York?

695
00:56:33,426 --> 00:56:36,095
I was in this cab, and this guy was...

696
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:39,932
"Galaxy on Orion's belt"
makes no sense.

697
00:56:39,932 --> 00:56:43,895
That's what the little dude inside
the big dude's head said, right?

698
00:56:44,437 --> 00:56:47,440
Damn, man!
You did the flashy thing already.

699
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,443
Whoever you are,
you'll have to show me I.D.

700
00:56:50,443 --> 00:56:53,446
Of course, young lady.
Look at this for me, please.

701
00:56:53,446 --> 00:56:55,448
- Would you stop that?
- What?

702
00:56:55,448 --> 00:56:57,950
That thing will give her brain cancer.

703
00:56:57,950 --> 00:57:00,453
Never hurt her before.
Close the doors.

704
00:57:00,453 --> 00:57:02,455
Special Services will be here.

705
00:57:02,455 --> 00:57:05,708
How many times have you
flashy-thinged that woman?

706
00:57:05,958 --> 00:57:06,959
Couple.

707
00:57:06,959 --> 00:57:10,254
- Don't you worry about long-term damage?
- A little.

708
00:57:10,463 --> 00:57:12,465
- Have you flashy-thinged me?
- No.

709
00:57:12,465 --> 00:57:15,051
I ain't playing with you! Have you?

710
00:57:24,477 --> 00:57:27,730
I think I should be in charge
of the flashy thing.

711
00:57:27,981 --> 00:57:29,482
Not while I'm around.

712
00:57:29,482 --> 00:57:31,985
You'll fricassee someone's brain.

713
00:57:31,985 --> 00:57:35,863
We got two dead aliens and
a medical examiner needs a new memory.

714
00:57:38,491 --> 00:57:40,576
Make it a happy memory.

715
00:58:14,027 --> 00:58:15,695
Where is it?!

716
00:59:00,114 --> 00:59:01,616
Hey, Zed.

717
00:59:02,116 --> 00:59:05,119
Doesn't anybody ever get
any sleep around here?

718
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:08,623
The twins keep us on Centurian time.
It's a 37-hour day.

719
00:59:09,123 --> 00:59:11,626
Give it a few months.
You'll get used to it.

720
00:59:11,626 --> 00:59:13,920
Or have a psychotic episode.

721
00:59:14,128 --> 00:59:15,129
Here's Orion.

722
00:59:15,129 --> 00:59:18,633
It's a grouping of the brightest stars
in the northern sky.

723
00:59:18,633 --> 00:59:21,135
- Here's Orion's belt.
- The little guy said:

724
00:59:21,135 --> 00:59:24,389
"To prevent war, the Galaxy
is on Orion's belt".

725
00:59:25,139 --> 00:59:27,642
There are no galaxies
on Orion's belt.

726
00:59:27,642 --> 00:59:31,062
The belt is just these three stars.
Galaxies are huge.

727
00:59:31,145 --> 00:59:34,565
They're made up of billions of stars.
You heard wrong.

728
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:38,778
Look, whatever, I know what I heard.

729
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:17,317
Pretty lady.

730
01:00:23,698 --> 01:00:27,869
That grumpy guy's story's starting to
come into focus a little bit here.

731
01:00:29,203 --> 01:00:32,582
So you were the guy in that picture
with the flowers?

732
01:00:33,207 --> 01:00:36,210
And, I take it,
she never got those flowers.

733
01:00:37,211 --> 01:00:40,173
So, what, she ever get married
or anything?

734
01:00:41,215 --> 01:00:44,218
They say it's better to have
loved and lost...

735
01:00:44,218 --> 01:00:46,721
than never to have loved at all.

736
01:00:46,721 --> 01:00:48,139
Try it.

737
01:00:53,728 --> 01:00:54,729
Look at this.

738
01:00:54,729 --> 01:00:56,689
They're all leaving.

739
01:00:56,731 --> 01:01:00,568
We've had 12 jumps in the last hour.
Redgick was just the first.

740
01:01:01,235 --> 01:01:03,696
What do they know that we don't?

741
01:01:03,738 --> 01:01:05,239
Why does a rat desert a ship?

742
01:01:05,239 --> 01:01:08,993
Give me Lem Sat 4, please,
with a proton induction thermoscan.

743
01:01:10,745 --> 01:01:13,039
Thank you. Okay. Lem Sat 18.

744
01:01:15,249 --> 01:01:17,043
All right, 4000.

745
01:01:20,755 --> 01:01:22,757
An Arquillian battle cruiser.

746
01:01:22,757 --> 01:01:25,551
And we've got
a dead Arquillian prince.

747
01:01:27,261 --> 01:01:29,180
Speak of the devil.

748
01:01:29,764 --> 01:01:30,765
They sound pissed.

749
01:01:30,765 --> 01:01:32,767
Translate that. Step on it.

750
01:01:32,767 --> 01:01:36,604
Go to Rosenberg's jewellery store,
and see what you can turn up.

751
01:01:42,276 --> 01:01:44,320
Give the kid a weapon.

752
01:01:53,287 --> 01:01:56,708
- Series 4 De-atomizer.
- That's what I'm talking about.

753
01:01:56,791 --> 01:01:58,501
Noisy Cricket.

754
01:02:00,294 --> 01:02:02,505
Kay, no, no, come on, man.

755
01:02:02,797 --> 01:02:05,300
You get a Series 4 De-atomizer...

756
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:07,802
I get a little midget Cricket?

757
01:02:11,306 --> 01:02:13,641
Feel like I'm gonna break it.

758
01:02:57,894 --> 01:02:59,937
Hey, this is my truck!

759
01:03:00,897 --> 01:03:04,108
Make sure you tell them that
down at the impound.

760
01:03:11,407 --> 01:03:12,825
Please.

761
01:03:22,919 --> 01:03:25,421
Who breaks into a jewellery store
and leaves the jewels?

762
01:03:25,421 --> 01:03:27,966
Somebody not looking forjewellery.

763
01:03:29,926 --> 01:03:32,762
This guy had a serious crush
on his cat.

764
01:03:35,139 --> 01:03:36,641
Get down!

765
01:03:41,437 --> 01:03:42,730
Man!

766
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,442
That's him. That's the bug!

767
01:03:46,442 --> 01:03:48,319
In the Edgar suit!

768
01:04:09,465 --> 01:04:12,468
We do not discharge our weapons
in view of the public!

769
01:04:12,468 --> 01:04:14,470
We ain't got time for this bullshit!

770
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:17,348
There's a alien battle cruiser
about to...

771
01:04:17,473 --> 01:04:20,476
There's always an alien battle
cruiser or a death ray...

772
01:04:20,476 --> 01:04:23,479
or an intergalactic plague
about to wipe out life on Earth.

773
01:04:23,479 --> 01:04:26,482
The only way people get on
with their happy lives...

774
01:04:26,482 --> 01:04:28,943
is they do not know about it!

775
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:36,367
And don't worry about the bug.

776
01:04:36,492 --> 01:04:39,287
He's not leaving town.
We got his ship.

777
01:04:46,502 --> 01:04:48,838
We need a containment crew...

778
01:04:49,005 --> 01:04:51,090
on MacDougal Street.

779
01:04:51,507 --> 01:04:54,927
Containment may be a moot point.
The exodus continues.

780
01:04:55,011 --> 01:04:59,015
The party's over, and the last one
to leave gets stuck with the check.

781
01:04:59,015 --> 01:05:01,225
You sorry little ingrates!

782
01:05:10,026 --> 01:05:11,527
What about the Arquillians?

783
01:05:11,527 --> 01:05:15,239
We've translated part of the message:
"Deliver the Galaxy".

784
01:05:15,531 --> 01:05:18,868
- They don't want much, do they?
- Oh, it gets better.

785
01:05:19,035 --> 01:05:21,204
They hold us responsible.

786
01:05:29,045 --> 01:05:31,339
Where do you keep your dead?

787
01:05:31,547 --> 01:05:33,591
I don't have any dead.

788
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:35,051
Where?

789
01:05:35,051 --> 01:05:36,719
I don't know.

790
01:05:37,053 --> 01:05:38,846
The city morgue?

791
01:05:49,065 --> 01:05:51,484
That's three for a dollar, sir!

792
01:05:52,068 --> 01:05:55,071
It was some light
that refracted off of Venus...

793
01:05:55,071 --> 01:05:57,073
into some swamp gas...

794
01:05:57,073 --> 01:05:58,574
and that's what made the....

795
01:05:58,574 --> 01:06:00,326
All right, kid!

796
01:06:01,077 --> 01:06:02,578
Excuse me.
What's up?

797
01:06:02,578 --> 01:06:05,581
The Arquillians want the Galaxy,
whatever that means.

798
01:06:05,581 --> 01:06:07,583
We need help, a professional...

799
01:06:07,583 --> 01:06:11,004
with years of experience
in intergalactic politics.

800
01:06:11,087 --> 01:06:14,090
I hope the little twerp
hasn't skipped town.

801
01:06:16,092 --> 01:06:18,094
If you'll gather over here....

802
01:06:18,094 --> 01:06:21,347
That's right, move in closer.
That's good. Thanks.

803
01:06:21,597 --> 01:06:24,976
If you look right here,
I'd appreciate it. Thank you.

804
01:06:38,156 --> 01:06:41,159
The worst disguise ever.
He's definitely an alien.

805
01:06:41,159 --> 01:06:44,245
You don't like it,
you can kiss my furry butt.

806
01:06:44,662 --> 01:06:45,663
Busy, Frank?

807
01:06:45,663 --> 01:06:48,166
Can't talk now.
My flight's leaving in...

808
01:06:48,166 --> 01:06:49,667
Get your paws off!

809
01:06:49,667 --> 01:06:51,169
Call the pound!

810
01:06:51,169 --> 01:06:53,171
The dog owes my friend money.

811
01:06:53,171 --> 01:06:55,173
Arquillians and bugs,
what do you know?

812
01:06:55,173 --> 01:06:57,300
- Nothing.
- Not a thing?

813
01:06:59,177 --> 01:07:01,679
Stop, stop, stop it!
Okay, okay!

814
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:04,682
Rosenberg wasn't a two-bit Arquillian.

815
01:07:04,682 --> 01:07:08,186
He was the guardian of the Galaxy.
He thought he'd be safe on Earth.

816
01:07:08,186 --> 01:07:09,187
The bug had other plans.

817
01:07:09,187 --> 01:07:13,149
The Galaxy is the best source
for subatomic energy in the universe.

818
01:07:13,691 --> 01:07:16,694
If the bugs get it,
kiss the Arquillians goodbye.

819
01:07:16,694 --> 01:07:17,695
Ask about the belt.

820
01:07:17,695 --> 01:07:20,698
Rosenberg mentioned Orion's belt.
What did he mean?

821
01:07:20,698 --> 01:07:22,784
- Beats me.
- Beats you?

822
01:07:23,201 --> 01:07:24,786
Not around.

823
01:07:27,205 --> 01:07:29,374
It's a ventriloquist act.

824
01:07:29,707 --> 01:07:31,626
The Galaxy is here!

825
01:07:32,210 --> 01:07:33,211
Here?

826
01:07:33,211 --> 01:07:36,089
A galaxy's millions of stars
and planets.

827
01:07:36,214 --> 01:07:39,217
When will you learn
that size doesn't matter?

828
01:07:39,217 --> 01:07:42,720
If something's important,
it doesn't mean it's not small.

829
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:43,721
How small?

830
01:07:43,721 --> 01:07:46,182
The size of a marble or a jewel.

831
01:07:46,224 --> 01:07:49,227
Excuse me. I gotta be walked
before my flight.

832
01:07:49,227 --> 01:07:51,020
Get out of here.

833
01:07:52,730 --> 01:07:55,858
If the Galaxy's here,
it's not on Orion's belt.

834
01:08:16,254 --> 01:08:18,506
When you want attention....

835
01:08:19,757 --> 01:08:20,758
Orion.

836
01:08:20,758 --> 01:08:22,760
That's a pretty name.

837
01:08:23,261 --> 01:08:24,887
What's this?

838
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:21,361
Yes, good, thank you.

839
01:09:21,361 --> 01:09:24,238
Thank you for making sure
the bell works.

840
01:09:27,367 --> 01:09:29,452
What's up, Farmer John?

841
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:33,122
A man came in here earlier.

842
01:09:33,873 --> 01:09:34,874
A dead man.

843
01:09:34,874 --> 01:09:37,085
And that means what to me?

844
01:09:38,878 --> 01:09:41,422
It was a very dear friend of mine.

845
01:09:42,382 --> 01:09:44,884
I believe he had an animal with him.

846
01:09:44,884 --> 01:09:47,387
It was a gift I gave him. A pet cat.

847
01:09:47,387 --> 01:09:49,389
It means worlds to me.

848
01:09:49,389 --> 01:09:51,391
I'd like to have it back.

849
01:09:51,391 --> 01:09:54,894
I'll need picture I.D.,
proof of ownership of the cat...

850
01:09:55,395 --> 01:09:58,564
notarized proof of kinship
with the deceased.

851
01:09:59,899 --> 01:10:01,609
Don't do that.

852
01:10:02,902 --> 01:10:04,362
Do what?

853
01:10:04,904 --> 01:10:06,531
Don't do it.

854
01:10:09,409 --> 01:10:10,868
Oh, man.

855
01:10:26,467 --> 01:10:28,970
Look, Kay, let me handle this one.

856
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:31,973
All we gotta do is get a cat.
It's not that hard.

857
01:10:31,973 --> 01:10:36,185
But if you go in there, you'll start
flashing your brain ray in her face.

858
01:10:36,477 --> 01:10:37,979
She'll wind up with leukemia.

859
01:10:37,979 --> 01:10:42,358
The doctor don't need you flashing away
her med-school classes. Five minutes.

860
01:10:42,483 --> 01:10:44,110
Two minutes.

861
01:10:45,987 --> 01:10:47,488
Where's the animal?

862
01:10:47,488 --> 01:10:48,990
I said I don't know.

863
01:10:48,990 --> 01:10:51,534
Well, let's see if we can find it.

864
01:10:56,998 --> 01:10:58,374
Hello!

865
01:11:07,008 --> 01:11:08,384
Hello!

866
01:11:12,513 --> 01:11:14,515
- How you doing?
- Hello.

867
01:11:14,515 --> 01:11:17,477
I'm Sergeant Friday
from the 26th Precinct.

868
01:11:17,518 --> 01:11:20,438
A cat came in with a corpse
the other day.

869
01:11:20,521 --> 01:11:23,107
- "Orion" on the nametag?
- Right.

870
01:11:23,524 --> 01:11:25,902
Well, this cat is a witness...

871
01:11:26,527 --> 01:11:29,489
in a murder case.
I'll need to take him.

872
01:11:29,530 --> 01:11:31,032
I don't know where the cat is.

873
01:11:31,032 --> 01:11:32,575
You don't?

874
01:11:33,034 --> 01:11:36,245
No, but maybe you could take me
with you instead.

875
01:11:37,538 --> 01:11:40,166
Damn, you do start fast,
don't you?

876
01:11:41,042 --> 01:11:43,044
I'd really like to go with you...

877
01:11:43,044 --> 01:11:44,462
now.

878
01:11:45,046 --> 01:11:47,173
And exactly why is that?

879
01:11:54,555 --> 01:11:56,891
I need to show you something.

880
01:11:57,058 --> 01:11:58,559
Slow down.

881
01:11:58,559 --> 01:12:02,063
- Girl, don't hit the gas like that!
- You don't understand.

882
01:12:02,063 --> 01:12:04,357
You really need to see this.

883
01:12:04,565 --> 01:12:08,194
I will. One thing. I gotta drive.
It's not some macho trip.

884
01:12:09,070 --> 01:12:11,489
That's just the way I get down.

885
01:12:23,084 --> 01:12:25,586
Look, stud, you're
really not getting this.

886
01:12:25,586 --> 01:12:28,631
There's something I need you
to help me with.

887
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,102
Freeze it!

888
01:12:41,102 --> 01:12:42,603
You are thick!

889
01:12:42,603 --> 01:12:43,604
How could I know?

890
01:12:43,604 --> 01:12:45,106
Did I have to sing it?

891
01:12:45,106 --> 01:12:47,108
You were like a drunk prom date.

892
01:12:47,108 --> 01:12:51,070
Typical. Anytime a woman shows
even a hint of sexual independence...

893
01:12:51,112 --> 01:12:52,113
Shut up!

894
01:12:52,113 --> 01:12:53,114
Let her go!

895
01:12:53,114 --> 01:12:55,116
Listen, monkey-boy...

896
01:12:55,116 --> 01:12:58,369
I'm on the top rung
of the evolutionary ladder.

897
01:12:58,619 --> 01:13:00,121
So can it.

898
01:13:00,121 --> 01:13:02,623
Show me your face,
and I'll cure your ills.

899
01:13:02,623 --> 01:13:06,127
Ever pull wings off a fly?
Care to see the fly get even?

900
01:13:06,627 --> 01:13:08,129
What about your ship?

901
01:13:08,129 --> 01:13:11,132
If that's what you call
that trash we got locked up.

902
01:13:11,132 --> 01:13:13,635
- Put your weapons down!
- Won't happen.

903
01:13:13,635 --> 01:13:15,136
It's okay.

904
01:13:15,136 --> 01:13:16,638
How is it okay?

905
01:13:16,638 --> 01:13:19,015
I'm saying it's gonna be okay.

906
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:21,392
Don't bet on it, meat sack.

907
01:13:30,652 --> 01:13:32,195
Let me go!

908
01:13:43,164 --> 01:13:44,540
Go on!

909
01:13:48,670 --> 01:13:50,171
Take me here.

910
01:13:50,171 --> 01:13:51,589
No way.

911
01:13:52,173 --> 01:13:53,633
Take me!

912
01:14:11,192 --> 01:14:12,902
He's in a cab!

913
01:14:34,757 --> 01:14:37,385
Don't move! Don't move!
Don't move!

914
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:39,512
Hey, man, what?

915
01:14:50,273 --> 01:14:53,401
He's not leaving the planet in a cab.
Let's go.

916
01:14:58,281 --> 01:15:00,783
Put up a bionet
all the way around Manhattan.

917
01:15:00,783 --> 01:15:03,411
If it's not human, it doesn't leave.

918
01:15:04,787 --> 01:15:06,289
What do we hear from upstairs?

919
01:15:06,289 --> 01:15:07,790
"Deliver the Galaxy".

920
01:15:07,790 --> 01:15:10,877
The bug's got the Galaxy,
but we got his ship.

921
01:15:14,297 --> 01:15:16,966
Warning..
Plutonic fusion detection.

922
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:20,470
Warning..
Plutonic fusion detection.

923
01:15:24,807 --> 01:15:27,310
- Why are they shooting at us?
- Battle rules.

924
01:15:27,310 --> 01:15:31,356
We get an ultimatum, a warning shot,
then a galactic week to respond.

925
01:15:32,315 --> 01:15:35,276
A galactic week?
How the hell long is that?

926
01:15:35,318 --> 01:15:36,319
One hour.

927
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:37,820
One hour?

928
01:15:38,321 --> 01:15:39,864
Then what?

929
01:15:44,827 --> 01:15:45,828
That's bullshit!

930
01:15:45,828 --> 01:15:49,957
To keep the bugs from getting it,
Arquillians will destroy that galaxy.

931
01:15:50,333 --> 01:15:52,627
And whatever planet it's on.

932
01:15:53,836 --> 01:15:55,838
You're talking about us.

933
01:15:55,838 --> 01:15:57,423
Sucks, huh?

934
01:15:59,842 --> 01:16:02,845
I'll get the location
of every interstellar vehicle.

935
01:16:02,845 --> 01:16:04,847
I already did.
Frank took the last ship.

936
01:16:04,847 --> 01:16:07,350
- Sneden's Landing and Throg's Neck.
- Gone.

937
01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:09,352
- What about Atlantic City?
- Gone.

938
01:16:09,352 --> 01:16:11,187
- Bayonne?
- Gone.

939
01:16:11,354 --> 01:16:13,856
- There's Three Mile Island.
- Gone.

940
01:16:13,856 --> 01:16:16,359
- Staten Island?
- Gone, thank God.

941
01:16:16,359 --> 01:16:20,363
We're running out of time. If that
bug gets off Earth, we're bug food.

942
01:16:20,363 --> 01:16:22,073
Hey, old guys!

943
01:16:26,869 --> 01:16:28,830
Do those still work?

944
01:16:43,886 --> 01:16:46,306
- You're coming with me.
- What?

945
01:16:46,389 --> 01:16:48,474
It's a long trip.
I'll need a snack.

946
01:16:48,474 --> 01:16:51,144
It's a long trip.
I'll need a snack.

947
01:16:55,398 --> 01:16:56,399
The tunnel?

948
01:16:56,399 --> 01:16:59,694
- You know a better way to Queens?
- It'll be packed!

949
01:17:12,915 --> 01:17:14,917
Remember the red button?

950
01:17:14,917 --> 01:17:16,878
Push the red button.

951
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:19,339
Put on a seat belt.

952
01:17:30,933 --> 01:17:33,895
You're much too tense.
You're young. Relax.

953
01:17:33,936 --> 01:17:35,938
Take some joy in your work.

954
01:17:35,938 --> 01:17:37,815
Do you like music?

955
01:17:41,444 --> 01:17:42,445
That's better.

956
01:17:42,445 --> 01:17:45,448
in Norfolk, Virginia
California on my mind

957
01:17:46,449 --> 01:17:49,452
I straddled that Greyhound
Androde him into Raleigh

958
01:17:49,452 --> 01:17:51,454
And on across Caroline

959
01:17:51,454 --> 01:17:54,123
Somebody help me
Get out ofLouisiana

960
01:17:56,459 --> 01:17:58,962
There are people there
Who care a little 'bout me

961
01:17:58,962 --> 01:18:02,131
- And won't let the poorboy down
- All right, now!

962
01:18:13,977 --> 01:18:15,979
You do know Elvis is dead?

963
01:18:15,979 --> 01:18:18,856
No, Elvis is not dead.
He just went home.

964
01:18:34,038 --> 01:18:35,540
You don't wanna eat me.

965
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:38,543
I'm an important person on my planet.
Like a queen!

966
01:18:38,543 --> 01:18:41,546
A goddess, even.
There are those who worship me.

967
01:18:41,546 --> 01:18:43,548
I'm not trying to impress you.

968
01:18:43,548 --> 01:18:46,050
I'm just saying it could start a war!

969
01:18:46,050 --> 01:18:48,553
Good, war. That means
more food for my family.

970
01:18:48,553 --> 01:18:52,015
All 78 million of them.
That's a lot of mouths to feed.

971
01:18:52,557 --> 01:18:55,601
You're a wonderful dad,
but I'm staying here!

972
01:19:16,581 --> 01:19:19,167
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

973
01:19:20,084 --> 01:19:21,919
Roaches check in.

974
01:19:24,088 --> 01:19:26,090
They don't check out.

975
01:19:30,094 --> 01:19:33,389
Warning.. Eight minutes
to the destruction ofEarth.

976
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,393
Eight minutes...

977
01:19:37,602 --> 01:19:39,479
to destruction.

978
01:20:23,648 --> 01:20:27,026
We'll use pulsar level five
with an implosion factor.

979
01:20:27,151 --> 01:20:28,152
What?!

980
01:20:28,152 --> 01:20:31,614
Just shoot the damn thing
on the count of three. One...

981
01:20:31,656 --> 01:20:33,366
two, three!

982
01:21:33,217 --> 01:21:34,802
You idiots!

983
01:21:36,220 --> 01:21:38,056
You don't get it!

984
01:21:38,222 --> 01:21:39,724
I've won.

985
01:21:39,724 --> 01:21:40,308
It's over.

986
01:21:40,308 --> 01:21:41,851
It's over.

987
01:21:42,226 --> 01:21:44,187
You're milk-suckers!

988
01:21:44,729 --> 01:21:46,564
You don't matter.

989
01:21:46,731 --> 01:21:49,233
In a few seconds,
you won't even be matter.

990
01:21:49,233 --> 01:21:52,236
You're under arrest
for violating the Tycho Treaty.

991
01:21:52,236 --> 01:21:55,239
So hand over whatever galaxy
you might be carrying...

992
01:21:55,239 --> 01:21:57,825
and put your hands on your head.

993
01:22:03,247 --> 01:22:05,208
I'll put my hands...

994
01:22:07,251 --> 01:22:08,962
on my head.

995
01:22:13,257 --> 01:22:14,801
Like this?

996
01:22:43,329 --> 01:22:45,832
That did not go the way I planned.

997
01:22:45,832 --> 01:22:47,834
Don't let him on the second ship.

998
01:22:47,834 --> 01:22:50,837
- What are you talking about?
- Keep him on this planet.

999
01:22:50,837 --> 01:22:52,797
Where are you going?

1000
01:22:53,339 --> 01:22:55,550
I'm gonna get my gun back.

1001
01:22:58,344 --> 01:22:59,345
Hey, bug!

1002
01:22:59,345 --> 01:23:02,348
You know how many of your kind
I've swatted with a paper?

1003
01:23:02,348 --> 01:23:05,226
You're just a smear
on the sports page...

1004
01:23:05,351 --> 01:23:08,354
you slimy, gut-sucking,
intestinal parasite!

1005
01:23:08,354 --> 01:23:09,772
Eat me!

1006
01:23:10,356 --> 01:23:11,774
Eat me!

1007
01:23:29,876 --> 01:23:31,377
What's up?

1008
01:23:31,377 --> 01:23:34,505
You just gonna eat and run?
What about dessert?

1009
01:23:40,386 --> 01:23:41,929
That's it?

1010
01:23:42,388 --> 01:23:45,683
Where you going?
This party's just getting started.

1011
01:23:46,392 --> 01:23:48,186
Where you going?

1012
01:23:48,895 --> 01:23:50,688
Where you going?

1013
01:23:51,898 --> 01:23:52,899
Let me tell you.

1014
01:23:52,899 --> 01:23:56,569
There's only one way off this planet,
and that's through me.

1015
01:24:39,946 --> 01:24:41,739
Where you going?

1016
01:24:42,448 --> 01:24:44,450
Why you running, huh?

1017
01:24:44,450 --> 01:24:46,369
I'm still standing.

1018
01:24:46,953 --> 01:24:49,247
Come on, bring it. Bring it!

1019
01:25:08,474 --> 01:25:10,977
I'm sorry.
Was that your auntie?

1020
01:25:13,479 --> 01:25:15,815
That means that's your uncle.

1021
01:25:17,984 --> 01:25:19,902
You all look alike.

1022
01:25:27,994 --> 01:25:29,579
Well, well.

1023
01:25:29,996 --> 01:25:32,957
Big, bad bug got
a bit of a soft spot, huh?

1024
01:25:37,003 --> 01:25:39,505
I can't understand why you gotta...

1025
01:25:39,505 --> 01:25:42,008
come down here
bringing all this ruckus...

1026
01:25:42,008 --> 01:25:44,844
snatching up galaxies
and everything.

1027
01:25:45,011 --> 01:25:48,431
My attitude is, don't start nothing,
won't be nothing.

1028
01:25:55,521 --> 01:25:59,150
Ease up out of my face before
something bad happens to you.

1029
01:26:01,027 --> 01:26:02,528
Too late.

1030
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:34,602
Tell the Arquillians
we have the Galaxy.

1031
01:26:34,602 --> 01:26:36,521
You got it, friend.

1032
01:26:38,106 --> 01:26:40,566
Going to get your gun back, huh?

1033
01:26:40,608 --> 01:26:42,402
I like this gun.

1034
01:26:42,610 --> 01:26:46,447
While you was in there playing around,
I was doing all the work.

1035
01:26:47,115 --> 01:26:50,326
I had to bean him in the head
with this big rock.

1036
01:26:50,618 --> 01:26:52,620
I was gonna hit him with a 2-by-4.

1037
01:26:52,620 --> 01:26:54,622
He kicked me. It hurt.

1038
01:26:54,622 --> 01:26:57,625
But then I got to the fire.
I was like that with it.

1039
01:26:57,625 --> 01:27:00,586
Not bad for your second
day of work, is it?

1040
01:27:00,628 --> 01:27:04,007
This definitely rates a 9.0
on my weird-shit-o-metre.

1041
01:27:04,632 --> 01:27:08,094
Should've been here for
the Zeronion migration in 1968.

1042
01:27:10,638 --> 01:27:13,349
I guess you weren't even alive in '68.

1043
01:27:19,147 --> 01:27:21,524
Interesting job you guys have.

1044
01:27:37,665 --> 01:27:39,959
I know we got these rules...

1045
01:27:40,168 --> 01:27:42,670
but she did help us bust that bug.

1046
01:27:42,670 --> 01:27:45,548
Maybe we didn't have to
flashy-thing her.

1047
01:27:46,674 --> 01:27:50,178
Come on. Who will she tell?
She hang out with dead people.

1048
01:27:50,178 --> 01:27:52,013
It's not for her.

1049
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:53,806
It's for me.

1050
01:27:55,183 --> 01:27:56,517
What?

1051
01:27:58,686 --> 01:28:00,730
Aren't they beautiful?

1052
01:28:01,689 --> 01:28:03,066
Stars.

1053
01:28:03,191 --> 01:28:06,611
I never look at them anymore,
but they actually are...

1054
01:28:08,696 --> 01:28:10,365
beautiful.

1055
01:28:15,203 --> 01:28:17,705
Kay, you're frightening your partner.

1056
01:28:17,705 --> 01:28:20,875
I've been training a replacement,
not a partner.

1057
01:28:21,709 --> 01:28:23,628
Wait a minute, Kay.

1058
01:28:23,711 --> 01:28:26,130
I cannot do this job by myself.

1059
01:28:26,214 --> 01:28:29,217
Guys, my apartment isn't
anywhere near here.

1060
01:28:29,217 --> 01:28:31,719
It's not even on the same island.

1061
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:34,138
Days...

1062
01:28:34,222 --> 01:28:35,723
months...

1063
01:28:35,723 --> 01:28:37,225
years.

1064
01:28:37,225 --> 01:28:39,310
Always face it forward.

1065
01:28:48,236 --> 01:28:51,239
I was in an interstellar
cockroach's gullet.

1066
01:28:51,239 --> 01:28:54,075
That's one of 100 memories
I don't want.

1067
01:29:10,758 --> 01:29:12,510
See you around.

1068
01:29:18,266 --> 01:29:19,600
No...

1069
01:29:20,268 --> 01:29:21,936
you won't.

1070
01:29:57,305 --> 01:29:59,807
The high consulate
from Solaxium 9...

1071
01:29:59,807 --> 01:30:02,310
wants seats for the Bulls game.

1072
01:30:02,310 --> 01:30:05,229
Call Dennis Rodman.
He's from that planet.

1073
01:30:06,814 --> 01:30:08,816
Rodman? You're kidding.

1074
01:30:08,816 --> 01:30:10,151
Nope.

1075
01:30:10,318 --> 01:30:12,403
Not much of a disguise.
