5,0:0:41,0:0:44,41,"And then one day, it was in a completely different room.",The Conjuring
6,0:0:44,0:0:46,44,It was moving around by itself.,The Conjuring
7,0:0:46,0:0:50,46,Ever think maybe somebody had a key to your apartment and was playing a trick?,The Conjuring
8,0:0:50,0:0:52,50,That's exactly what we thought.,The Conjuring
9,0:0:53,0:0:55,53,But never once did we find any sign or evidence of intrusion.,The Conjuring
10,0:0:55,0:0:58,55,And this all led you to believe that the doll was possessed?,The Conjuring
11,0:0:58,0:1:0,58,Yes.,The Conjuring
12,0:1:0,0:1:4,60,Camilla got in touch with a medium. We learned from her that a 7yearold girl...,The Conjuring

17,0:1:16,0:1:19,76,"I mean, we're nurses, we help people.",The Conjuring
18,0:1:19,0:1:20,79,So...,The Conjuring
19,0:1:21,0:1:24,81,...we gave her permission to move into the doll.,The Conjuring
20,0:1:24,0:1:26,84,"Wait, you did what?",The Conjuring
21,0:1:26,0:1:29,86,She wanted to live with us by inhabiting the doll.,The Conjuring
22,0:1:29,0:1:30,89,We said yes.,The Conjuring
23,0:1:30,0:1:33,90,But then things got worse.,The Conjuring
24,0:1:47,0:1:48,107,God.,The Conjuring
25,0:1:51,0:1:54,111,"When we came home, she was sitting in the hallway.",The Conjuring
26,0:1:54,0:1:56,114,But we had left her in the spare room.,The Conjuring
27,0:2:34,0:2:36,154,"Debbie! Debbie, wait!",The Conjuring
28,0:3:51,0:3:53,231,We are beyond terrified.,The Conjuring
29,0:3:53,0:3:57,233,We don't know what's going on or what to do. Can you help us?,The Conjuring
30,0:3:59,0:4:0,239,"Yes, we can.",The Conjuring
31,0:4:0,0:4:5,240,"Now, firstly, there's no such thing as Annabelle, and there never was.",The Conjuring
32,0:4:5,0:4:7,245,Ghosts don't possess such power.,The Conjuring
33,0:4:7,0:4:10,247,I think what we have here is something extremely manipulative.,The Conjuring
34,0:4:10,0:4:12,250,It's something inhuman.,The Conjuring
35,0:4:12,0:4:14,252,It was a big mistake acknowledging this doll.,The Conjuring
36,0:4:15,0:4:17,255,"And through that, the inhuman spirit tricked you.",The Conjuring
37,0:4:17,0:4:20,257,You gave it permission to infest your lives.,The Conjuring
38,0:4:20,0:4:22,260,What's an inhuman spirit?,The Conjuring
39,0:4:23,0:4:26,263,It's something that's never walked the earth in human form.,The Conjuring
40,0:4:26,0:4:28,266,It's something demonic.,The Conjuring
41,0:4:32,0:4:34,272,So the doll was never possessed?,The Conjuring
42,0:4:34,0:4:36,274,"No, no, it was used as a conduit.",The Conjuring
43,0:4:37,0:4:39,277,It was moved around to give the impression of possession.,The Conjuring
44,0:4:39,0:4:43,279,"Demonic spirits don't possess things, they possess people.",The Conjuring
45,0:4:44,0:4:46,284,It wanted to get inside of you.,The Conjuring
46,0:4:55,0:4:59,295,"All right, that's good, Drew. You can shut it down now.",The Conjuring
47,0:5:0,0:5:2,300,Hit the lights.,The Conjuring
48,0:5:5,0:5:7,305,So we got the church to send a priest over...,The Conjuring
49,0:5:7,0:5:9,307,...to bless the house and the occupants.,The Conjuring
50,0:5:9,0:5:13,309,Whatever was oppressing that apartment was no longer with them. Any questions?,The Conjuring
