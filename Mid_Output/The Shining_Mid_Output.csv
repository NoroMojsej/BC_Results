9,0:3:48,0:3:51,228," Susie, how do you do?  Any trouble finding us?",The Shining
10,0:3:51,0:3:54,231,No problem at all. I made the trip in 31/2 hours.,The Shining
11,0:3:54,0:3:56,234,That's very good time.,The Shining
12,0:3:56,0:3:58,236,"Sit down a minute, Jack.",The Shining
13,0:3:58,0:4:0,238,Just make yourself at home.,The Shining
14,0:4:0,0:4:1,240,Like some coffee?,The Shining
15,0:4:2,0:4:4,242,"If you're having some, I wouldn't mind. Thanks.",The Shining
16,0:4:4,0:4:5,244, Susie.  Sure.,The Shining

18,0:4:7,0:4:9,247,"Yes, I will.",The Shining
19,0:4:20,0:4:21,260,Mom?,The Shining
20,0:4:22,0:4:23,262,Yeah?,The Shining
21,0:4:23,0:4:27,263,Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?,The Shining
22,0:4:28,0:4:29,268,Sure I do.,The Shining
23,0:4:29,0:4:31,269,It'll be lots of fun.,The Shining
24,0:4:33,0:4:35,273,Yeah. I guess so.,The Shining
25,0:4:35,0:4:39,275,"Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.",The Shining
26,0:4:40,0:4:44,280,I know. It always takes a little time to make new friends.,The Shining
27,0:4:45,0:4:48,285,"Yeah, I guess so.",The Shining
28,0:4:48,0:4:49,288,What about Tony?,The Shining
29,0:4:50,0:4:52,290,"He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet.",The Shining
30,0:4:53,0:4:55,293,"No, I ain't, Mrs. Torrance.",The Shining
31,0:4:55,0:4:58,295,"Now, come on, Tony. Don't be silly.",The Shining
32,0:4:58,0:5:0,298,I don't want to go there.,The Shining
33,0:5:1,0:5:3,301,How come you don't want to go?,The Shining
34,0:5:3,0:5:5,303,I just don't.,The Shining
35,0:5:5,0:5:7,305,Let's just wait and see.,The Shining
36,0:5:8,0:5:10,308,We're all going to have a real good time.,The Shining
37,0:5:12,0:5:14,312,"Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.",The Shining
38,0:5:14,0:5:16,314,"How do you do, Bill?",The Shining
39,0:5:16,0:5:18,316, Nice to meet you.  Pleasure to meet you.,The Shining
40,0:5:18,0:5:20,318,"Grab a chair, Bill. Join in.",The Shining
41,0:5:20,0:5:25,320,Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.,The Shining
42,0:5:25,0:5:28,325,I'd like you to take him around soon as we're through.,The Shining
43,0:5:28,0:5:29,328,Fine.,The Shining
44,0:5:30,0:5:31,330,Jack is a schoolteacher.,The Shining
45,0:5:32,0:5:34,332,Formerly a schoolteacher.,The Shining
46,0:5:34,0:5:36,334,What line of work are you in now?,The Shining
47,0:5:36,0:5:37,336,I'm a writer.,The Shining
48,0:5:38,0:5:41,338,Teaching's been more or less a way of making ends meet.,The Shining
49,0:5:41,0:5:43,341,This ought to be quite a change for you.,The Shining
50,0:5:44,0:5:46,344,I'm looking for a change.,The Shining
51,0:5:46,0:5:50,346,"Our people in Denver recommended Jack very highly, and for once...",The Shining
52,0:5:50,0:5:52,350,...I agree with them.,The Shining
53,0:5:52,0:5:54,352,"Let's see, where were we?",The Shining
54,0:5:54,0:5:57,354,I was about to explain...,The Shining
55,0:5:57,0:6:1,357,...that our season here runs from May 15th to October 30th.,The Shining
56,0:6:2,0:6:5,362,Then we close down completely until the following May.,The Shining
57,0:6:5,0:6:8,365,Do you mind if I ask why you do that?,The Shining
58,0:6:8,0:6:12,368,It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.,The Shining
59,0:6:12,0:6:15,372,It would be. The problem is the enormous cost...,The Shining
60,0:6:15,0:6:17,375,...it would be to keep the road to Sidewinder open.,The Shining
61,0:6:18,0:6:20,378,It's a 25mile stretch of road.,The Shining
62,0:6:20,0:6:22,380,It gets 20 feet of snow during the winter.,The Shining
63,0:6:22,0:6:26,382,There's just no way to make it economically feasible...,The Shining
64,0:6:26,0:6:28,386,...to keep it clear.,The Shining
65,0:6:28,0:6:30,388,When the place was built in 1907...,The Shining
66,0:6:31,0:6:33,391,...there was very little interest in winter sports.,The Shining
67,0:6:33,0:6:38,393,This site was chosen for its seclusion and scenic beauty.,The Shining
68,0:6:38,0:6:41,398,It's certainly got plenty of that.,The Shining
69,0:6:41,0:6:42,401,That's right.,The Shining
70,0:6:43,0:6:45,403,Did they give you any idea in Denver...,The Shining
71,0:6:46,0:6:47,406,...about what the job entails?,The Shining
72,0:6:48,0:6:50,408,Only in a very general way.,The Shining
73,0:6:52,0:6:55,412,The winters can be fantastically cruel.,The Shining
74,0:6:55,0:6:58,415,The basic idea is to cope with the very costly damage...,The Shining
75,0:6:58,0:7:0,418,...and depreciation which can occur.,The Shining
76,0:7:1,0:7:3,421,This consists mainly of running the boiler...,The Shining
77,0:7:3,0:7:7,423,...heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis...,The Shining
78,0:7:7,0:7:10,427,...repairing damage as it occurs...,The Shining
79,0:7:10,0:7:13,430,...and doing repairs so the elements can't get a foothold.,The Shining
80,0:7:14,0:7:16,434,That sounds fine to me.,The Shining
81,0:7:17,0:7:20,437,"Physically, it's not a very demanding job.",The Shining
82,0:7:20,0:7:23,440,The only thing that can get a bit trying here during the winter...,The Shining
83,0:7:23,0:7:26,443,...is a tremendous sense of isolation.,The Shining
84,0:7:27,0:7:32,447,That just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.,The Shining
85,0:7:32,0:7:35,452,I'm outlining a new writing project.,The Shining
86,0:7:36,0:7:39,456,Five months of peace is just what I want.,The Shining
87,0:7:40,0:7:41,460,"That's very good, Jack.",The Shining
88,0:7:42,0:7:45,462,"Because, for some people...",The Shining
89,0:7:45,0:7:47,465,...solitude...,The Shining
90,0:7:47,0:7:49,467,...and isolation...,The Shining
91,0:7:50,0:7:52,470,"...can, of itself, become a problem.",The Shining
92,0:7:53,0:7:54,473,Not for me.,The Shining
93,0:7:55,0:7:58,475,How about your wife and son? Do you think they'll take to it?,The Shining
94,0:8:0,0:8:1,480,They'll love it.,The Shining
95,0:8:1,0:8:2,481,Great.,The Shining
96,0:8:5,0:8:8,485,Before I turn you over to Bill...,The Shining
97,0:8:9,0:8:12,489,...there's one other thing I think we should talk about.,The Shining
98,0:8:12,0:8:14,492,Not to sound melodramatic...,The Shining
99,0:8:14,0:8:17,494,...but it's been known to give a few people...,The Shining
100,0:8:17,0:8:19,497,...second thoughts about the job.,The Shining
101,0:8:20,0:8:21,500,I'm intrigued.,The Shining
102,0:8:22,0:8:24,502,I don't suppose they said anything in Denver...,The Shining
103,0:8:24,0:8:28,504,...about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970.,The Shining
104,0:8:29,0:8:31,509,I don't believe they did.,The Shining
105,0:8:33,0:8:35,513,My predecessor in this job...,The Shining
106,0:8:36,0:8:39,516,...hired a man named Charles Grady as the winter caretaker.,The Shining
107,0:8:39,0:8:43,519,He came up with his wife and 2 little girls of about 8 and 10.,The Shining
108,0:8:43,0:8:46,523,"He had a good employment record, good references.",The Shining
109,0:8:46,0:8:48,526,"And from what I've been told, he seemed...",The Shining
110,0:8:49,0:8:51,529,...like a completely normal individual.,The Shining
111,0:8:51,0:8:54,531,But at some point during the winter...,The Shining
112,0:8:54,0:8:58,534,...he must have suffered some kind of a complete mental breakdown.,The Shining
113,0:8:58,0:9:0,538,He ran amuck...,The Shining
114,0:9:4,0:9:6,544,...and killed his family with an ax.,The Shining
115,0:9:7,0:9:12,547,"Stacked them neatly in a room in the west wing, and then...",The Shining
116,0:9:13,0:9:16,553,...he put both barrels of his shotgun in his mouth.,The Shining
117,0:9:18,0:9:19,558,The police thought...,The Shining
118,0:9:20,0:9:24,560,...that it was what the oldtimers used to call cabin fever.,The Shining
119,0:9:24,0:9:27,564,A kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur...,The Shining
120,0:9:27,0:9:31,567,...when people are shut in together over long periods of time.,The Shining
121,0:9:36,0:9:38,576,That is...,The Shining
122,0:9:38,0:9:39,578,...quite a story.,The Shining
123,0:9:41,0:9:42,581,"Yeah, it is.",The Shining
124,0:9:43,0:9:47,583,It's still hard for me to believe it actually happened here.,The Shining
125,0:9:47,0:9:49,587,But it did.,The Shining
126,0:9:50,0:9:54,590,I think you can appreciate why I wanted to tell you about it.,The Shining
127,0:9:55,0:9:57,595,I certainly can.,The Shining
128,0:9:58,0:10:0,598,I also understand why your people in Denver...,The Shining
129,0:10:1,0:10:3,601,...left it for you to tell me.,The Shining
130,0:10:4,0:10:7,604,"Obviously, some people can be put off...",The Shining
131,0:10:7,0:10:11,607,...from staying in a place where something like that happened.,The Shining
132,0:10:11,0:10:16,611,You can rest assured that's not going to happen with me.,The Shining
133,0:10:16,0:10:20,616,And as far as my wife is concerned...,The Shining
134,0:10:20,0:10:24,620,...I'm sure she'll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her.,The Shining
135,0:10:24,0:10:27,624,She's a confirmed ghost story...,The Shining
136,0:10:27,0:10:30,627,...and horror film addict.,The Shining
137,0:10:36,0:10:39,636,"Tony, do you think Dad'll get the job?",The Shining
138,0:10:41,0:10:43,641,He already did.,The Shining
139,0:10:43,0:10:47,643,He's going to phone Wendy up in a few minutes to tell her.,The Shining
140,0:11:2,0:11:5,662," Hi, babe.  Hi, hon. How's it going?",The Shining
141,0:11:5,0:11:8,665,Great. I'm at the hotel and I still have a lot to do.,The Shining
142,0:11:9,0:11:12,669,I don't think I can get home before 9 or 10.,The Shining
143,0:11:12,0:11:13,672,Sounds like you got the job.,The Shining
144,0:11:14,0:11:16,674,Right. It's a beautiful place.,The Shining
145,0:11:17,0:11:19,677,You and Danny are going to love it.,The Shining
146,0:11:20,0:11:23,680,"Tony, why don't you want to go to the hotel?",The Shining
147,0:11:23,0:11:25,683,I don't know.,The Shining
148,0:11:26,0:11:30,686,"You do too know. Now come on, tell me.",The Shining
149,0:11:30,0:11:32,690,I don't want to.,The Shining
150,0:11:33,0:11:34,693,Please.,The Shining
151,0:11:35,0:11:37,695,No.,The Shining
152,0:11:37,0:11:39,697,"Now, Tony, tell me.",The Shining
153,0:12:9,0:12:11,729,"Now, hold your eyes still so I can see.",The Shining
154,0:12:16,0:12:18,736,That's good. Now the other one.,The Shining
155,0:12:19,0:12:21,739,Good boy.,The Shining
156,0:12:28,0:12:30,748,"Now, Danny...",The Shining
157,0:12:30,0:12:32,750,...when you were brushing your teeth...,The Shining
158,0:12:32,0:12:35,752,...do you remember if you smelled anything funny...,The Shining
159,0:12:35,0:12:40,755,"...or saw any bright, flashing lights or anything at all strange?",The Shining
160,0:12:43,0:12:44,763,No.,The Shining
161,0:12:45,0:12:48,765,Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?,The Shining
162,0:12:48,0:12:50,768,Yes.,The Shining
163,0:12:51,0:12:54,771,What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?,The Shining
164,0:12:59,0:13:1,779,"My mom was saying, ""Wake up. Wake up, Danny, wake up.""",The Shining
165,0:13:6,0:13:8,786,Can you remember what you were doing...,The Shining
166,0:13:8,0:13:11,788,...just before you started brushing your teeth?,The Shining
167,0:13:13,0:13:15,793,Talking to Tony.,The Shining
168,0:13:16,0:13:18,796,Is Tony one of your animals?,The Shining
169,0:13:19,0:13:22,799,No. He's a little boy that lives in my mouth.,The Shining
170,0:13:22,0:13:25,802,Tony's his imaginary friend.,The Shining
171,0:13:28,0:13:31,808,"If you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?",The Shining
172,0:13:34,0:13:35,814,Why not?,The Shining
173,0:13:36,0:13:38,816,Because he hides.,The Shining
174,0:13:39,0:13:40,819,Where does he go?,The Shining
175,0:13:42,0:13:43,822,To my stomach.,The Shining
176,0:13:45,0:13:48,825,Does Tony ever tell you to do things?,The Shining
177,0:13:52,0:13:55,832,I don't want to talk about Tony anymore.,The Shining
178,0:13:58,0:13:59,838,That's fine.,The Shining
179,0:14:0,0:14:2,840,"All right, Danny.",The Shining
180,0:14:2,0:14:5,842,I'm going to ask you to do me a favor...,The Shining
181,0:14:6,0:14:9,846,...and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day. Okay?,The Shining
182,0:14:9,0:14:10,849,Do I have to?,The Shining
183,0:14:10,0:14:13,850,Yes. I'd like you to.,The Shining
184,0:14:13,0:14:16,853,We're going in the other room for a few minutes and talk.,The Shining
185,0:14:16,0:14:18,856,I'll come back and check on you.,The Shining
186,0:14:26,0:14:29,866, Shall we go into the living room?  Yes.,The Shining
187,0:14:33,0:14:34,873, Please.  Thank you.,The Shining
188,0:14:38,0:14:43,878,"Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about.",The Shining
189,0:14:43,0:14:47,883,I'm quite sure there's nothing physically wrong with Danny.,The Shining
190,0:14:52,0:14:55,892,He seems absolutely fine now.,The Shining
191,0:14:55,0:14:56,895,But you should've seen him.,The Shining
192,0:14:57,0:14:58,897,I know.,The Shining
193,0:14:58,0:15:0,898,Kids can scare you to death.,The Shining
194,0:15:0,0:15:3,900,"But believe me, these episodes are not at all uncommon.",The Shining
195,0:15:3,0:15:5,903,And they look much worse than they are.,The Shining
196,0:15:6,0:15:9,906,But what was the matter with him?,The Shining
197,0:15:9,0:15:13,909,"Most of the time, these episodes with kids are never explained.",The Shining
198,0:15:13,0:15:18,913,They're brought on by emotional factors and rarely occur again.,The Shining
199,0:15:19,0:15:22,919,They're more akin to autohypnosis...,The Shining
200,0:15:22,0:15:25,922,...a kind of selfinduced trance.,The Shining
201,0:15:25,0:15:27,925,"If it reoccurs, which I doubt...",The Shining
202,0:15:28,0:15:31,928,...we can always think about having some tests done.,The Shining
203,0:15:34,0:15:36,934,I'm sure you're right.,The Shining
204,0:15:38,0:15:40,938,Have you been in Boulder long?,The Shining
205,0:15:41,0:15:42,941,Only about three months.,The Shining
206,0:15:43,0:15:46,943,We're from Vermont. My husband was teaching school there.,The Shining
207,0:15:48,0:15:52,948,Did the appearance of Danny's imaginary friend...,The Shining
208,0:15:52,0:15:53,952,Tony.,The Shining
209,0:15:53,0:15:57,953,Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?,The Shining
210,0:16:0,0:16:2,960,Let's see...,The Shining
211,0:16:2,0:16:5,962,I guess Danny started talking to Tony...,The Shining
212,0:16:5,0:16:8,965,...about the time we put him in nursery school.,The Shining
213,0:16:8,0:16:11,968,Did he adjust well to school?,The Shining
214,0:16:13,0:16:15,973,He didn't like it too much at first.,The Shining
215,0:16:15,0:16:18,975,"Then he had an injury, so we kept him out for a while and...",The Shining
216,0:16:20,0:16:24,980,I guess that's about when I first noticed he was talking to Tony.,The Shining
217,0:16:25,0:16:27,985,What sort of injury did he have?,The Shining
218,0:16:28,0:16:30,988,He dislocated his shoulder.,The Shining
219,0:16:30,0:16:33,990,How did he manage to do that?,The Shining
220,0:16:36,0:16:39,996,"It was just one of those things, you know.",The Shining
221,0:16:39,0:16:41,999,Purely an accident.,The Shining
222,0:16:42,0:16:45,1002,My husband had been drinking...,The Shining
223,0:16:45,0:16:49,1005,...and he came home about three hours late.,The Shining
